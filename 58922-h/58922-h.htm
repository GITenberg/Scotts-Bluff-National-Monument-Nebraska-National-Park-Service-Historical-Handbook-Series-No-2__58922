<p>SCOTTS BLUFF <i>was a celebrated landmark on the great North Platte
Valley trunkline of &ldquo;the Oregon Trail,&rdquo; the traditional route of overland
migration to Oregon, California, and Utah. Today the massive
castellated bluff looks down upon concrete highways, railways, airports, irrigated
farms, and bustling communities of the mid-20th century; but it is
the same awe-inspiring sentinel which 100 years ago watched the passage of
countless trains of ox-drawn covered wagons, and the twinkling of many
campfires. Scotts Bluff National Monument keeps alive the epic story of our
ancestors who dared cross the wilderness of plains and mountains to plant
the western stars in the American flag.</i></p>
<p>Present Scotts Bluff is but a part of the historic &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs&rdquo; named
for Hiram Scott, an employee of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company,
whose skeleton was found in the vicinity in 1829. The first known
published reference is to be found in <i>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville</i>,
by Washington Irving, published in 1837. The first map to
show this landmark is in Robert Greenhow&rsquo;s <i>Memoir, Historical and
Political on the Northwest Coast of North America</i>, published in 1840.
It appeared next in the Fremont map of 1843, which became basic for
later emigrant guides.</p>

to mythical <i>Quivira</i>, which proved to be only a squalid Indian village
in central Kansas. Contrary to long-held belief, Coronado never
reached present Nebraska. The first Spaniards known to have penetrated
this state&mdash;an exploring party of 1720 led by Pedro de Villasur&mdash;were
massacred by Pawnees at the forks of the Platte.</p>

<p>Following LaSalle&rsquo;s traverse of the Mississippi and the establishment
of French settlements along that river, several French explorers&mdash;notably
Bourgmont and Charlevois&mdash;penetrated the fringe of the
Great Plains, bringing back reports of strange shaggy beasts in numbers
so vast that they blackened the landscape. The Platte River was
named by Frenchmen who explored its lower reaches; for this is the
French word for &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; a literal translation of the Oto word, &ldquo;Nebrathka.&rdquo;
The Upper Platte was not explored by Frenchmen until
1739 when the Mallet brothers lead a small party from the mouth of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the Niobrara across Nebraska, up the South Platte, and thence to
Santa Fe. The high tide of French exploration of the Plains was
marked in 1743 by the long journey, on foot, of the Verendrye
brothers from the Missouri River westward. How far west they
traveled has been a widely debated subject, but most scholars believe
that they reached the vicinity of the Black Hills of South Dakota.</p>
<p>The famous Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-6, dispatched by
President Jefferson to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Territory,
followed the natural passageway of the upper Missouri and Columbia
Rivers to become the first Americans to cross the continent. While
they triumphantly returned to St. Louis, Lt. Zebulon Pike visited a
Pawnee village on the Upper Republican River, then proceeded
southwestward up the Arkansas. In the wake of these official explorers
came the fur trappers and traders, a strange breed of men who
traced out and rough-mapped the tributary streams of the western
plains and mountains in their search for beaver hides. The early
history of Scotts Bluff is closely linked with the history of the western
American fur trade.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>First White Men at Scotts Bluff</i></span></h2>
<p>Fur traders were the first white men known to have seen Scotts
Bluff. They were the returning Astorians&mdash;a group of seven men
under Robert Stuart, traveling from their trading post at the mouth
of the Columbia River to St. Louis. On Christmas day, 1812, Stuart
recorded in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>21 miles same course brought us to camp in the bare Prairie, but were
fortunate in finding enough of driftwood for our culinary purpose. The
Hills on the south have lately approached the river, are remarkably
rugged and Bluffy and possess a few Cedars. Buffaloe very few in numbers
and mostly Bulls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Astorian Expedition of 1811, so-called because it was an enterprise
of the wealthy fur trader, John Jacob Astor, comprised the second
group of Americans to span the continent. Led by Wilson Price
Hunt, the &ldquo;Astorians&rdquo; ascended the Missouri River until they were
blocked by the treacherous Arikara or &ldquo;Ree&rdquo; Indians near the mouth
of Grand River. Then they traveled overland, skirting the Black Hills
and the Bighorn Mountains, and reached their Columbia River headwaters
via Jackson Hole. Joining forces with another Astor group
who had reached the mouth of the Columbia by ship, they built
Astoria, the first American trading post on the Pacific slope. In 1812,
Robert Stuart and his small band started back overland to carry messages
to Astor. By their successful mission they performed one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
great feats of western exploration, for in their perilous journey eastward
they blazed the route via the Upper Snake, Green, and North
Platte Rivers which was destined to become the Oregon Trail! (See
map on pages <a href="#Page_30">30</a>, 31.)</p>
<p>Constantly imperiled by exposure, starvation, and Indians, they
crossed the Continental Divide near South Pass and descended the
Sweetwater and North Platte Rivers. After they had passed Scotts
Bluff, the hostility of the wintry Plains impelled them to retrace their
steps to a point near present Torrington, Wyo., where they camped
for the winter and built canoes. Early in the spring of 1813 they resumed
their journey. They were unable to navigate the shallow,
braided, upper reaches of the Platte River, and it was not until they
reached Grand Island, that they successfully launched their canoes.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Rediscovery of the Central Overland Route</i></span></h2>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s journal was not published until many years later, and the tremendous
import of his geographical discovery&mdash;a central route across
the continent&mdash;was lost amid preoccupation with the War of 1812
and the seizure of Astoria by the British forces. For the next decade
the fur traders, operating out of St. Louis, concentrated on sending
expeditions up the Missouri River, persisting in their notion that this
was the only logical route westward. Manual Lisa, William Ashley,
Andrew Henry, and Joshua Pilcher were among the leaders of numerous
invasions of the Upper Missouri country. Beaver pelts were
plentiful, but the Blackfoot, Ree, Gros Ventre, and other Indian
tribes were unfriendly. A series of disastrous encounters with these
Indians reached a crisis in 1823, when a large fur brigade under William
Ashley was treacherously attacked above Grand River by the
Rees, the same who had blocked the path of the Astorians 11 years
before. An appeal for military aid resulted in an expedition from Fort
Atkinson (above present Omaha) under Col. Henry Leavenworth.
The Indian villages were besieged but the results were indecisive.
Thereupon Ashley and his men abandoned their efforts on the Upper
Missouri, and struck out overland to the mountains. This decision
led to the discovery of the rich beaver valleys of the central Rockies,
and the rediscovery of South Pass and the Great Platte route. It ushered
in the historic Rocky Mountain fur trade, and opened a new
chapter in the history of Scotts Bluff.</p>
<p>Among the enterprising young men employed by Ashley, who received
their baptism of fire at the Ree villages, were several destined
to achieve great fame in the annals of the West. Conspicuous among
them were Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost, who soon discovered the
Great Salt Lake; Jedediah Smith, who led a band of trappers across
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
the Black Hills and the Bighorn Mountains to explore the headwaters
of the Green and Snake Rivers, and to become the first American to
challenge the supremacy of British fur traders in the Oregon country;
William Sublette, who became the founder of Fort William on the
Laramie River; Thomas Fitzpatrick, noted &ldquo;mountain man,&rdquo; emigrant
guide, and Indian agent; and Hiram Scott, one of Ashley&rsquo;s clerks who
would soon die tragically near the bluff which now bears his name.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Ree Indian attack on General Ashley&rsquo;s trappers.</i> Original sketch in

</div>
<p>If any white men traveled by Scotts Bluff in the decade following
the downstream passage of the returning Astorians, they left no distinct
record. It is surmised that Canadian half-breeds roamed and
trapped in this region during this period since several geographic
names of French origin seem to have survived from the earliest days
of the fur trade. Laramie or &ldquo;La Ramee&rdquo; River and Goshen or
&ldquo;Goche&rsquo;s&rdquo; Hole, both in nearby Wyoming, tell of early trappers about
whom there survive only the haziest traditions. We can only say
that the second group of white men in the North Platte Valley who
can be positively identified were four of Ashley&rsquo;s trappers who, in the
spring of 1824, attempted to bring their beaver pelts down the Platte
River. With this event, Scotts Bluff once more emerges on the pages
of history.</p>
<p>Following a successful harvest of beaver, Jedediah Smith delegated
Thomas Fitzpatrick, James Clyman, and two others to transport the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
pelts to Fort Atkinson. This led directly to the rediscovery of the
strategic Platte route and the beginning of a half century during which
Scotts Bluff became one of the great landmarks of that historic route.
Fitzpatrick failed in his effort to transport the furs down the Sweetwater
by bullboat (Indian boat made from buffalo hides stretched over
a frame of green willow boughs) and, lacking horses, was compelled
to cache them near Independence Rock. He and his companions were
subsequently scattered by marauding Indians, but they all arrived
safely at Fort Atkinson. Fitzpatrick promptly took horses back to
Independence Rock to retrieve his furs, and so passed Scotts Bluff three
times in 1824.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Annual rendezvous of Rocky Mountain trappers.</i> Original sketch in

</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>The Rocky Mountain Fur Trade</i></span></h2>
<p>Ashley was impressed by Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s report on the success of his employees
in locating rich beaver territory. Late in the autumn of 1824,
he hurried westward up the Platte River, sending his brigades out to
trap while he personally led an exploration of the lower canyons of
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the Green River. In 1825, reunited with his men at Henry&rsquo;s Fork of
the Green, he led them to the head of Wind River where they constructed
boats and floated their cargo to St. Louis via the Bighorn,
Yellowstone, and Missouri Rivers.</p>
<p>Ashley is credited with conceiving a new scheme of handling the
mountain fur trade which became known as the rendezvous system.
Instead of building expensive fixed trading posts in the wilderness, dependent
upon the Indian trade, the idea was to send white trappers to
camp out all winter, trapping while the beaver were in prime fur, then
all to foregather at some prearranged mountain valley where they
would meet traders bringing pack trains of equipment and trade goods
from St. Louis. Casks of whisky, standard trade items, insured that
the annual mountain carnival or rendezvous would see not only a
rapid exchange of trade goods for beaver pelts, but also carousing and
roistering on a scale suitable to compensate the trappers for their long
lonely winter vigils. For 15 years Scotts Bluff would witness traders&rsquo;
caravans, going mountainward in early summer, and returning in the
autumn laden with their harvest of furs.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1826 the first of the colorful traders&rsquo; caravans, led
by Ashley, Sublette, and Smith, and probably including young Hiram
Scott, passed the yet unnamed bluff en route to the first big rendezvous,
on the shores of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The swarthy,
colorfully garbed trappers escorted 300 pack-laden mules on this trip.
At Salt Lake there were two notable events. Ashley, who had now
become comfortably rich from skimming the cream of the beaver trade,
sold his interests to a partnership which became known as the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company, and Smith embarked on the first of his notable
expeditions across the Great Basin to California, becoming the
first American to reach that Mexican province by this route.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>The Tragedy of Scotts Bluff</i></span></h2>
<p>The year 1827 went much as those before, with another rendezvous at
Salt Lake where Smith reported his adventures. He then set off on
another California trip (followed by a side trip up the Pacific Coast to
Oregon, where most of his men were massacred by Indians on the
Umpquah). Hiram Scott was among the traders who returned that
year to St. Louis. This we know from a document dated October 16,
1827, preserved in the files of the Missouri Historical Society, for Scott
is there listed as an employee of Ashley (who continued to operate the
supply train), having earned $280 in wages for his season&rsquo;s labor.</p>
<p>That Scott ranked high in the esteem of the fur trading fraternity is
attested not only by this document but also by the official records of
the Leavenworth Expedition of 1823, wherein Scott shares with Jedediah
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Smith the distinction of being a &ldquo;captain of volunteers&rdquo; under
General Ashley. In another document, a letter of April 11, 1827, written
by Ashley at Lexington, Mo., Scott is described as &ldquo;alive to our
interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;properly efficient.&rdquo; One other source implies that he
was a trader of high rank. These meager facts are all we know about
Hiram Scott, who was doomed to die mysteriously a year later, while
returning with the homeward-bound caravan of the Rocky Mountain
Fur Company.</p>
<p>The facts concerning Hiram Scott&rsquo;s death are even scarcer than those
about his career. There is a wealth of tradition and legend, but these
cannot be accepted as established facts. Of the innumerable versions,
almost no two are identical.</p>
<p>The classic account of Scott&rsquo;s death, and the one first published (in
1837), is that given in Washington Irving&rsquo;s story of the adventures of
Capt. Benjamin Bonneville, on leave from the United States Army.
Irving relates that on June 21, 1832, the Bonneville party</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... encamped amid high and beetling cliffs of indurated clay and sandstone,
bearing the semblance of towers, castles, churches and fortified
cities. At a distance it was scarcely possible to persuade one&rsquo;s self that
the works of art were not mingled with these fantastic freaks of nature.
They have received the name of Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs from a melancholy circumstance.
A number of years since, a party were descending the upper part
of the river in canoes, when their frail barks were overturned and all their
powder spoiled. Their rifles being thus rendered useless, they were unable
to procure food by hunting and had to depend upon roots and wild
fruits for subsistence. After suffering extremely from hunger, they arrived
at Laramie&rsquo;s Fork, a small tributary of the north branch of the
Nebraska, about sixty miles above the cliffs just mentioned. Here one
of the party, by the name of Scott, was taken ill; and his companions
came to a halt, until he should recover health and strength sufficient to
proceed. While they were searching round in quest of edible roots they
discovered a fresh trail of white men, who had evidently but recently preceded
them. What was to be done? By a forced march they might
overtake this party, and thus be able to reach the settlements in safety.
Should they linger they might all perish of famine and exhaustion. Scott,
however, was incapable of moving; they were too feeble to aid him forward,
and dreaded that such a clog would prevent their coming up with
the advance party. They determined, therefore, to abandon him to his
fate. Accordingly, under pretence of seeking food, and such simples as
might be efficacious in his malady, they deserted him and hastened forward
upon the trail. They succeeded in overtaking the party of which
they were in quest, but concealed their faithless desertion of Scott; alleging
that he had died of disease.</p>
<p>On the ensuing summer, these very individuals visiting these parts in
company with others, came suddenly upon the bleached bones and grinning
skull of a human skeleton, which by certain signs they recognized
for the remains of Scott. This was sixty long miles from the place where
they had abandoned him; and it appeared that the wretched man had
crawled that immense distance before death put an end to his miseries.
The wild and picturesque bluffs in the neighborhood of his lonely grave
have ever since borne his name.</p>

</div>
<p>A very touching and pathetic story, but it is quite different from the
version offered by Warren Ferris of the American Fur Company. In
1830, he passed Scotts Bluff on the north side of the river 2 years
ahead of Captain Bonneville, and just 2 years after the event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We encamped opposite to &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs,&rdquo; so called in respect to the memory
of a young man who was left here alone to die a few years previous.
He was a clerk in a company returning from the mountains, the leader of
which found it necessary to leave him behind at a place some distance
above this point, in consequence of a severe illness which rendered him
unable to ride. He was consequently placed in a bullhide boat, in charge
of two men, who had orders to convey him by water down to these bluffs,
where the leader of the party promised to await their coming. After a
weary and hazardous voyage, they reached the appointed rendezvous, and
found to their surprise and bitter disappointment, that the company had
continued on down the river without stopping for them to overtake and
join it.</p>
<p>Left thus in the heart of a wide wilderness, hundreds of miles from any
point where assistance or succour could be obtained, and surrounded by
predatory bands of savages thirsting for blood and plunder, could any condition
be deemed more hopeless or deplorable? They had, moreover, in
descending the river, met with some accident, either the loss of the means
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of procuring subsistence or defending their lives in case of discovery and attack.
This unhappy circumstance, added to the fact that the river was
filled with innumerable shoals and sand-bars, by which its navigation was
rendered almost impracticable, determined them to forsake their charge
and boat together, and push on night and day until they should overtake
the company, which they did on the second or third day afterward.</p>
<p>The reason given by the leader of the company for not fulfilling his
promise, was that his men were starving, no game could be found, and
he was compelled to proceed in quest of buffalo.</p>
<p>Poor Scott! We will not attempt to picture what his thoughts must
have been after his cruel abandonment, nor harrow up the feelings of the
reader, by a recital of what agonies he must have suffered before death
put an end to his misery.</p>
<p>The bones of a human being were found the spring following, on the
opposite side of the river, which were supposed to be the remains of
Scott. It was conjectured that in the energy of despair, he had found
strength to carry him across the stream, and then had staggered about the
prairie, till God in pity took him to Himself.</p>
<p>Such are the sad chances to which the life of the Rocky Mountain adventurer
is exposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hiram Scott legend is mentioned by almost all early travelers
who have left record of a journey up the North Platte Valley, but it
would be fruitless to recite the many other varied, conflicting, and often
quaint versions of how he died. There are differences of opinion as
to the distance the poor fellow crawled, if any; whether the party
traveled on foot or by horseback, muleback, bullboat, raft, or canoe;
whether he was a victim of Indians, exposure, drowning, freezing,
disease, or starvation; the location of his skeleton; the identity and
number of his companions; whether their desertion was premeditated;
whether it was justified; how their treachery was exposed; and, finally,
whether the whole thing might not have been a grisly hoax!</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="pcap"><i>Dome Rock from summit of North Bluff.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>It was not a hoax. Though the legend has become hopelessly confused,
research has proved that there was a Hiram Scott prominent in
the Rocky Mountain fur trade from 1823 until 1827; and that he disappeared
in 1828 and was never heard from thereafter, except through
the faint echoes of the legend. His companions remain unidentified,
but research strongly suggests that William Sublette was the leader
of the 1828 caravan, who issued instructions to these men to remain
with him; and it was William Sublette who led the springtime caravan
of 1829 that discovered Scott&rsquo;s skeleton, miles away from the spot
where they reported he had died.</p>
<p>Rufus B. Sage, who passed the bluff in 1841, was particularly impressed
with the melancholy circumstances of Scott&rsquo;s death, and was
moved to impassioned poetry:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No willing grave received the corpse</p>
<p class="t">of this poor lonely one;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">His bones, alas, were left to bleach</p>
<p class="t">and moulder &rsquo;neath the sun!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The night-wolf howl&rsquo;d his requiem,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">the rude winds danced his dirge;</p>
<p class="t0">And e&rsquo;er anon, in mournful chime</p>
<p class="t">sigh&rsquo;s forth the mellow surge!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The spring shall teach the rising grass</p>
<p class="t">to twine for him a tomb;</p>
<p class="t0">And, o&rsquo;er the spot where he doth lie,</p>
<p class="t">shall bid the wild flowers bloom.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But, far from friends, and far from home,</p>
<p class="t">ah, dismal thought, to die!</p>
<p class="t0">Ah, let me &rsquo;mid my friends expire,</p>
<p class="t">and with my fathers lie.</p>
</div>
<p>The mountain men have engraved their names on the topography
of the West with such place names as Scotts Bluff, Jackson Hole,
Colter Bay, Bridger Pass, Sublette County, Provo, Ogden, and Carson
City which forever remind us of these colorful figures with seven-league
boots who spearheaded the invasion of the West.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>The First Wagons</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1827 Ashley had sent a wheeled cannon up the Platte route to impress
the Indians at Great Salt Lake. However, the first bona fide
wagons on the Oregon Trail were those of the Smith-Jackson-Sublette
caravan of 1830, headed for the rendezvous scheduled in the Wind
River Valley, near present Lander. In a famous letter to Secretary of
War Eaton, the partners reported</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>a caravan of ten wagons, drawn by five mules each, and two dearborns,
drawn by one mule each ... eighty-one men in company, all mounted
on mules....</p>
<p>For our support, at leaving the Missouri settlements, until we should
get into the buffalo country, we drove twelve head of cattle, beside a milk
cow.... We began to fall in with the buffaloes on the Platte, about
three hundred and fifty miles from the white settlements; and from that
time lived on buffaloes, the quantity being infinitely beyond what we
needed.... The country being almost all open, level, and prairie, the
chief obstructions were ravines and creeks, the banks of which required
cutting down, and for this purpose a few pioneers were generally kept
ahead of the caravan. This is the first time that wagons ever went to the
Rocky mountains; and the ease and safety with which it was done prove
the facility of communicating over land with the Pacific ocean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Wind River the parties sold their interest to another group of
seasoned trappers&mdash;Fitzpatrick, Bridger, Fraeb, Gervais, and Milton
Sublette. Thus far the Rocky Mountain Fur Company had a monopoly
of the choice beaver country, except for occasional brushes with
the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in the Snake River country. Now an
ominous rival presented itself, Astor&rsquo;s powerful American Fur Company,
which sought to regain the trading empire lost during the War
of 1812. In a brief time Astor&rsquo;s company would outmaneuver the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, absorb its leaders, and take over the
monopoly. But first there would be fierce competition. In the vanguard
of this invasion came a pack train headed by Joseph Robidoux
and William Vanderburgh. They passed Scotts Bluff on May 27, on
the north side of the river, just a few days behind their rivals. Robidoux
and Vanderburgh&rsquo;s adventures have been chronicled by Warren
Ferris.</p>
<p>Hiram Scott was not the only casualty in this dangerous fur trading.
Jedediah Smith was slain by Comanches in 1831 on the Cimarron
River, en route to Santa Fe. Vanderburgh was soon killed by Blackfeet
Indians near the Three Forks of the Missouri. Kit Carson later
killed a fellow trapper in a duel over an Arapahoe maiden on the Upper
Hoback River, and Thomas Fitzpatrick suffered serious injuries from
a near-fatal encounter with the Gros Ventres. The mortality rate
among the mountain men was high, but the survivors continued their
annual rendezvous. The decade of the 1830&rsquo;s was the golden age of
the fur trade.</p>
<p>Captain Bonneville, who launched the Hiram Scott legend, made
history in 1832 by taking his loaded wagons across the Continental
Divide at South Pass, foreshadowing the mighty covered wagon migration
that would begin within a decade. While Bonneville built a fort
on the Upper Green, the rendezvous of 1832 was held in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole,
on the west slope of the Tetons, and here the assembled trappers had
a famous pitched battle with the Gros Ventres, which resulted in several
fatalities.</p>

</div>
<p>Among those in Sublette&rsquo;s train in 1833 was Sir William Drummond
Stewart of Scotland, a wealthy adventurer, the first of a series
of notable Britishers to travel through the West, recording their impressions.
We are indebted to him, as well as to Warren Ferris,
Osborne Russell, and Joe Meek for vivid pictures of the wild and colorful
rendezvous scenes. From 1833 until 1840, these rendezvous were
held on the Upper Green, near present Daniel, Wyo.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Traders, Missionaries, and Adventurers</i></span></h2>
<p>The year 1834 was a lively one along the trappers&rsquo; trail up the North
Platte. This was the year that Robert Campbell and William Sublette
halted their caravan at the mouth of Laramie&rsquo;s Fork, some 60
miles above Scotts Bluff, to establish log-palisaded Fort William, the
first of a succession of trading posts, and later a military post, which
became the great way-station on the Oregon Trail, called Fort Laramie.
A few days behind Sublette, Nathaniel Wyeth led a caravan
upriver to establish rival Fort Hall in Idaho. With Wyeth were
Thomas Nuttall and John Townsend, the first men of scientific attainments
to follow the trail, and Jason and Daniel Lee, first Methodist
missionaries to Oregon.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>In 1835, when the American Fur Company emerged as the dominant
trading concern, it took over Fort William on the Laramie and
placed Lucien Fontenelle in charge there. That year Presbyterian
missionaries Samuel Parker and Marcus Whitman accompanied
Fontenelle and the traders&rsquo; caravan to the rendezvous on the Green
River, then went on to scout the Oregon country.</p>
<p>Impressed by what he saw, Marcus Whitman quickly returned to
the States to organize more missionaries. In 1836 he brought his
wife, Narcissa, and the Rev. Henry Spalding and his wife, Elizabeth,
westward to Oregon. These two white women, the first ever to see
Scotts Bluff and the first to reach Oregon, were well guarded on their
journey by the veteran Thomas Fitzpatrick and his swarthy crew.</p>
<p>At Scotts Bluff the Whitman party met company employees from
Fort Laramie, descending the Platte River in fur-laden bullboats.
This was to become a common method of transporting furs to St.
Louis, although the shallow Platte was poorly suited to navigation,
and the boats often came to grief on sandbars. The trips could only
be made during the June rise of the Platte. Since travelers from the
States usually arrived at Scotts Bluff by mid-June, the trappers&rsquo; boats
were often reported in this vicinity.</p>
<p>It was in 1837 that Scotts Bluff, the martial sentinel of the North
Platte Valley, stood for its first portrait. The magnificent sketch, now
preserved in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, was the work of
Alfred J. Miller, a talented artist who accompanied Sir William Drummond
Stewart and William Sublette to the Green River rendezvous.
Miller&rsquo;s notes on Scotts Bluff reflect the same awe and imagination
that inspired countless later emigrants. He writes, &ldquo;At a distance as
we approached it the appearance was that of an immense fortification
with bastions, towers, battlements, embrazures, scarps and
counterscarps.&rdquo; He records also that this neighborhood abounded in
delicious &ldquo;Rocky Mountain pheasant,&rdquo; and in jack rabbits, antelope, and
bighorn.</p>
<p>The supply train of 1838, led by Andrew Drips, was accompanied
by another missionary party, including the journalist Myra F. Eells,
who commented on the &ldquo;grand scenery&rdquo; of the bluffs, and the Swiss
fortune hunter, August Johann Sutter, on whose California ranch
the discovery of gold 10 years later would precipitate the most famous
migration in American history.</p>
<p>In 1839, Dr. Frederick Wislizenus from St. Louis, traveling to Fort
Laramie with the caravan led by Moses Harris, described the bluff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... We traveled somewhat away from the river, toward the left, and
enjoyed a picturesque landscape. All about were rocks piled up by
Nature in merry mood, giving full scope to fancy in the variety of
their shapes. Some were perfect cones; others flat round tops; others,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
owing to their crenulated projections, resembled fortresses; others old
castles, porticos, etc. Most of them were sparsely covered with pine and
cedar. The scenery has obvious resemblance to several places in Saxon
Switzerland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last of the traditional rendezvous was held in 1840 on the
Green River. This year&rsquo;s expedition was led by Andrew Drips, and it
was made notable by two parties who accompanied it. One was the
Joel Walker family, the first avowed Oregon emigrants; the others
were Jesuit priests headed by Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, who would
become one of the West&rsquo;s most prodigious travelers and reporters.
Like many others, De Smet, impressed by the scenery of the North
Platte, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... In the neighborhood of this wonder [Chimney Rock], all the hills
present a singular aspect; some have the appearance of towers, castles and
fortified cities. From a little distance, one can hardly persuade himself
that art is not mingled in them with the fantasies of nature. Bands of
the <i>ashata</i>, an animal called also <i>grosse-corne</i>, or bighorn, have their abode
in the midst of these bad lands.... [Scotts Bluff], with its castles and
fantastic cities, forms the termination of a high ridge, which runs from
south to north. We found a narrow passage through between two perpendicular
cliffs 300 feet in height [Mitchell Pass].</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>Migration to Oregon</i></span></h2>
<p>The era of the transcontinental covered wagon migrations began in
1841, for in that year came the initial band of 80 Oregon homeseekers,
guided by Thomas Fitzpatrick and accompanied by Father De
Smet on his second western journey. John Bidwell was the historian
of this expedition. Another traveler was Joseph Williams, an elderly
but energetic Methodist preacher, who described the building of Fort
John (the second Fort Laramie). Although the beaver trade had declined,
a brisk trade with the Indians for buffalo robes continued, and
the American Fur Company would occupy Laramie&rsquo;s Fork for eight
more years.</p>
<p>Dr. Elijah White, the new agent for the Oregon Indians, lead a
party of 112 westward in 1842. Among them was Medorem Crawford,
who described Scotts Bluff as &ldquo;the most romantic scenery I ever
saw.&rdquo; Lansford W. Hastings, who was to write one of the first emigrant
guidebooks, was also of this party. Lt. John C. Fremont&rsquo;s first
expedition to the Rocky Mountains traveled up the Platte in 1842;
his official report would likewise become a standard reference. He
described Scotts Bluff as &ldquo;an escarpment on the river of about 900
yards in length&rdquo; which &ldquo;forces the road to make a considerable circuit
over the uplands.&rdquo; He found the plain between the bluffs and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Chimney Rock almost entirely covered with driftwood, testifying to
a recent flood.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Rut of the Oregon Trail at Scotts Bluff.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1843 Scotts Bluff witnessed the first mass migration to Oregon;
it was promoted by Marcus Whitman. In May more than 1,000 persons,
including 130 women and 610 children, left Independence, Mo.,
for the long trek overland. This well-organized expedition, with military
rules to ensure protection, an elected captain, and division into
companies, set the pattern for the hundreds of emigrant trains to follow.
The elected captain was Peter Burnett who was to become the
first Governor of California in 1850. The &ldquo;Cow Column,&rdquo; the last
and slowest of the 1843 companies, has achieved fame through the
writings of Jesse Applegate. Overton Johnson relates that the train
reached camp &ldquo;by a fine Spring, at the foot of Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs&rdquo; on July 9.</p>
<p>Close behind the emigrant families came an elaborate hunting party,
led by Sir William Stewart and William Sublette, making their farewell
visit to the mountains. Baptiste Charbonneau, the infant son
who had been carried by Sacajawea on the Lewis and Clark Expedition,
was hired as a driver. William Clark Kennerly&rsquo;s reminiscences
of this journey tells of a frightening incident that occurred near Scotts
Bluff:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Far out on the Platte one morning, while making preparations for our
daily hunt, we descried coming toward us a herd, which I can state without
any exageration must have numbered a million. The pounding of
their hooves on the hard prairie sounded like the roaring of a mighty
ocean, surging over the land and sweeping everything before it. Here
was more game than we bargained for, and the predicament in which
we now found ourselves gave us much cause for alarm. On they came,
and as we were directly in their path and on the bank of the river, there
was great danger of our being swept over. This danger was averted
only by our exerting every effort to turn them off in another direction;
and as it took the herd two entire days to pass, even at quite a rapid
gait, we were kept busy placing guards of shouting, gesticulating men
in the daytime and building huge bonfires at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1844 four emigrant trains passed Scotts Bluff
bound for Oregon. One of these was piloted by James Clyman, who
had first seen the bluff 20 years before on his long hike from Independence
Rock to Fort Atkinson. In his diary Clyman wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... encamped in the midtst of Scotts blufs By a cool spring in a romantic
&amp; picturisque vally surounded except to the E. by high &amp; allmost impassably
steep clay cliffs of all immagenary shapes &amp; forms supped on
a most dlecious piece of venison from the loin of a fat Black taild Buck
and I must not omit to mention that I took my rifle and (and) walked
out in the deep ravin to guard a Beautifull covey of young Ladies &amp;
misses while they gathered wild currants &amp; choke chirries which grow
in great perfusion in this region and of the finerst kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trek to Oregon in 1845 dwarfed all that had gone before. An
informal count at Fort Laramie revealed that 5,000 people and 500
ox-drawn wagons were on the march. The charms of Scotts Bluff,
and the tragic tale of its namesake, were not lost on the many diarists,
among them Joel Palmer, who credits &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs&rdquo; with a good
spring and an abundance of wood and grass. Below the bluffs, says
Palmer,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We met a company of mountaineers from Fort Laramie, who had started
for the settlements early in the season, with flat-boats loaded with buffalo
robes, and other articles of Indian traffic. The river became so low,
that they were obliged to lay by; part of the company had returned to
the fort for teams; others were at the boat landing, while fifteen of the
party were footing their way to the States. They were a jolly set of
fellows....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this same big year the United States Government sent its first
military expedition up the Platte. Guided by Fitzpatrick, Col. S. W.
Kearny led five companies of the First Dragoons to South Pass. A
few days ahead of the Oregon Trek, on June 11 they encamped &ldquo;below
Scotts Bluffs, and directly opposite a large village of Dacotah
[Sioux] Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>... that immense and celebrated pile, called &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs,&rdquo; advances
across the plain nearly to the water&rsquo;s edge. If one could increase the
size of the Alhambra of Grenada, or the Castle of Heidelberg, which
Professor Longfellow has so poetically and so graphically described,&mdash;twenty
fold in every way but in height,&mdash;he could form some idea of the
magnitude and splendor of this chef d&rsquo;oeuvre of Nature at Palace-Building.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>Years of Decision, 1846-48</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1846, the Oregon Territory, long in dispute with Great Britain,
was finally acquired by peaceful compromise. The emigrant families
who had passed Scotts Bluff had ensured this outcome by tipping the
scales of population! Meanwhile, in May 1846, the United States had
declared war on Mexico and, in the name of &ldquo;manifest destiny,&rdquo; set
about adding California and the Southwest to its territory.</p>
<p>The emigration of 1846 was lighter than that of the preceding year.
One company, the Donner party, met appalling disaster in the early
autumn snows of the Sierra Nevadas. Edward Bryant, a future Governor
of California, and J. Quinn Thornton both wrote the most extravagant
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and fanciful descriptions of Scotts Bluff and nearby hills.
They imagined &ldquo;the ruins of some ancient vast city,&rdquo; complete with
domes, towers, temples, minarets, amphitheaters, frowning parapets,
and even &ldquo;a royal bath,&rdquo; a fittingly picturesque backdrop for the
lingering death of &ldquo;the unhappy trapper&rdquo; who crawled here after
being abandoned by &ldquo;inhuman companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1846 young historian Francis Parkman, whose journal, <i>The Oregon
Trail</i>, would become one of the classics of our literature, made his
famous trip to Fort Laramie. After camping &ldquo;by the well-known
spring on Scott&rsquo;s Bluff&rdquo; he rode out in the morning and &ldquo;descending
the western side of the bluff,&rdquo; came upon &ldquo;old Smoke&rsquo;s lodges.&rdquo; Here
he launches into his first exciting description of a Sioux encampment,
with its handsome lazy warriors, dusky maidens, and the &ldquo;old withered
crones&rdquo; who did all the work!</p>
<p>Also in 1846, after mob violence against their city of Nauvoo, Ill.,
the Mormons began their great western trek. They encamped
for the winter on the Missouri at Kanesville (Council Bluffs) and
Winter Quarters (Omaha), where hundreds died of disease and exposure.
In the spring of 1847 the Mormon pioneers, 144 strong under
Brigham Young, traveled to their promised land, Great Salt Lake Valley
in Utah. Avoiding the &ldquo;gentiles&rdquo; who followed the Oregon Trail
up the south bank of the Platte, the Mormons remained on the north
bank until they reached Fort Laramie, using the old trappers&rsquo; trail
to Fort Atkinson. Probably no expedition in history has been better
chronicled. Among the many meticulous Mormon journalists was
William Clayton, who later wrote one of the better trail guides. On
May 27 he reported that the company &ldquo;passed the meridian of the
northernmost peaks of Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs.&rdquo; The view toward these bluffs,
&ldquo;resembling ancient ruins,&rdquo; was &ldquo;majestic and sublime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mormon emigration almost monopolized the trail in 1848.
Some 4,000 of the faithful journeyed to Utah up the north bank, opposite
the bluff, while a comparative handful of emigrants followed
the usual route to Oregon. But this was the quiet before the storm.
In 1848 James Marshall discovered gold on Captain Sutter&rsquo;s ranch.
The news traveled by fast clipper ship around Cape Horn to New
York City. The California gold rush would soon burst in a torrent
up the North Platte migration corridor.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>Scotts Bluff and The Forty-niners</i></span></h2>
<p>Early in the spring the Forty-niners converged by steamboat upon the
Missouri River towns of Independence, Westport, and St. Joseph;
assembled wagons, animals, and provisions; and organized into companies.
Eager to reach the new Eldorado, they were undismayed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the prospective 2,000-mile trek across hostile plains and mountains.
On May 1, as soon as the prairie grass was green, the great gold rush
began. The Oregon Trail became the California Road.</p>
<p>The trail from Independence, up the Kansas and Blue Rivers, joined
the trail from St. Joseph near present Marysville, Kans., then followed
up the Little Blue to its source to reach the &ldquo;Coast of Nebraska,&rdquo; historic
Platte River. Just beyond was Fort Kearny, established in 1847,
now commanded by the same Captain Bonneville who first took
wagons across the Continental Divide 17 years before.</p>
<p>Onward from Fort Kearny the white-hooded prairie schooners
crawled like an army of gigantic ants along the south bank of the
Platte. The Forty-niners were awed by the vast emptiness of the treeless
plains, the endless horizon, the shimmering haze, and the
sudden, drenching thunderstorms. Pushing beyond the forks of the
Platte, they followed the margin of the South Platte to near the present
town of Ogallala, Nebr. Here, at what was called Lower California
Crossing, they ferried or swam the river amid scenes of shouting
confusion, then headed for the North Platte.</p>
<p>Hundreds of extant emigrant journals vividly describe the classic
trunk route of the Oregon-California Trail up the North Platte. From
the plateau the trail descended rather abruptly via steep Windlass Hill
down Ash Hollow (near Lewellyn) to the river. Hugging the south
bank, the trail passed many curious hills and formations which afforded
welcome relief from the monotonous scenery. Courthouse and
Jail Rocks near present Bridgeport, Chimney Rock near Bayard, and
Scotts Bluff were among the most notable of these landmarks, which
so frequently aroused poetic fancies and rapturous descriptions in emigrant
journals.</p>
<p>At Scotts Bluff in 1849 the trail made a wide detour, south of the
present monument, up Gering Valley, and over Robidoux Pass, then
northwest to regain the Platte near the mouth of Horse Creek.</p>
<p>Sixty miles beyond the bluff the Forty-niners came to historic adobe-walled
Fort Laramie (Fort John of the American Fur Company), which
was in the very process of being purchased by the United States Army.
The Stars and Stripes were hauled up at the fort on June 26, and the
army immediately began the construction of new buildings. Pausing
here only briefly to rest and obtain provisions, the emigrants continued
west and north via the North Platte and the Sweetwater toward
the Continental Divide, guided by such landmarks as Laramie
Peak, Red Butte, Independence Rock, Devil&rsquo;s Gate, and Split Rock.
Just beyond broad, barren South Pass, flanked by the snow-covered
Wind River Mountains, the Forty-niners reached the edge of the Pacific
drainage. They still had a grueling journey over mountain and
desert before they would reach the end of their rainbow.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Cavalcade of the Forty-niners.</i> Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
</div>
<p>The California gold rush of 1849 and ensuing years, in addition to
being on a much larger scale, was entirely different in character from
the earlier Oregon migration. Oregon travelers were families, seeking
farms; most of the California emigrants were young men, unmarried
or unaccompanied by wives, who were seeking a quick fortune.
Young women who did make the hazardous journey were besieged
with suitors. There were weddings and honeymoons on the trail.
There are also records of gold rush babies born in wagon beds.</p>
<p>After a rugged day on the trail, the evening campfire was often the
occasion for yarn-swapping and sentimental songs, like <i>Oh, Susanna!</i>
It can be imagined that these campfire scenes were commonplace at
Scotts Bluff, and the tale of Hiram Scott&rsquo;s tragic death was doubtless
repeated with endless variations. The prevailing mood was not always
gay. The haunting mystery of Scotts Bluff struck a fittingly
somber note for the Forty-miners. Before the epic drama of the gold-rush
was played out a few years later, 20,000 of these adventurous
emigrants had died and lined the California Road with their graves.</p>
<p>Asiatic cholera was the greatest killer. Ships docking at New Orleans
brought infected people who carried the dread disease by steamboat
up the Mississippi to St. Louis. There, the disease spread by
contagion to people in the Missouri River outfitting towns. As the
tired Argonauts struggled across the unfamiliar Nebraska landscape,
the disease raced like wildfire among them, decimating their number.
Children were orphaned. The husband who buried his wife might
himself be dead the next day. Numerous diaries record inscriptions
on the crude headboards of the hastily dug shallow graves. Hundreds
of burials took place in the North Platte Valley between Ash
Hollow and Fort Laramie. Several have been identified at Scotts
Bluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Many of those who escaped the cholera plague were confronted
with other killers&mdash;the rugged terrain, inexperience, carelessness, exhaustion.
Some dropped by the wayside from sheer fatigue. Others
died of pneumonia, or were drowned at the river crossings, or shot
themselves with unfamiliar firearms, got run over by the big lumbering
wagon wheels, or were gored by unruly oxen. Another menace
was the buffalo, which was hunted as a fine source of food. Unless
approached gingerly, big herds of these creatures would sometimes
stampede, making the earth tremble, trampling to death the unwary
hunter. In the desert of the Great Basin, more of the travelers were
killed by the intense heat, alkali dust, and parching thirst. The trek
of the Forty-niners was not for long a gay escapade; it became a grim
survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular impression, the number of emigrants who died
at the hands of marauding Indians was negligible. The Diggers
along the Humboldt River in Nevada accounted for some stragglers;
the Plains Indians were a bit thievish but peaceful&mdash;for a time, at least.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
True, at nights the wagons were arranged in a circular compound and
guards were posted; but an Indian attack on the emigrants Hollywood
style, was a rarity.</p>
<p>Although visions of an Indian raid served as a healthy influence on
emigrant vigilance, daily preoccupation with the necessities of life was
a more pressing concern. There were three primary needs&mdash;food,
grazing, and good campsites. Although some of the better organized
companies had ample provisions, many others miscalculated and suffered
accordingly. True, buffalo, antelope, and other game were
hunted; but the wildlife was frightened by the endless, noisy, dusty
column, and the hunters who galloped forth with romantic notions
of a dashing buffalo hunt often came back empty-handed.</p>
<p>The ideal campsite would boast a good spring and a generous supply
of timber for campfires and the repair of wagon gear. There were
a few such campsites&mdash;Scotts Bluff with its springs and its ponderosa
pine and cedars was one of the best&mdash;but these soon suffered from
the pressure of converging crowds. Clear springs were muddied, the
sparse groves of timber were chopped away, and the grass vanished
from overgrazing or withered in the summer sun.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="537" />
<p class="pcap"><i>In camp at Chimney Rock.</i> Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
</div>
<p>The emigrant guidebooks&mdash;Hastings, Fremont, Joseph Ware, and
others&mdash;were usually adequate as a rough index to the whereabouts
of obvious landmarks and choice campsites, but they were deficient
in sound advice to the tenderfoot. It wasn&rsquo;t always possible to reach
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
a good campsite, and then one had to camp out on the prairie, conserving
the precious water supply and eating a cold supper. Smart
emigrants learned the old trappers&rsquo; practice of gathering <i>bois du vache</i>
(dried buffalo dung) to make an acrid but usable campfire.</p>
<p>A typical wagon train with all its encumbrances, plus quicksand,
mud, creek crossings, and other difficulties of terrain, could make but
15 to 20 miles per day over the level plains. In rough mountain
country, progress was even slower; and there had to be frequent halts
to rest worn-out, emaciated stock and to mend faulty gear. Thus it
took perhaps 4 months for a train to reach a California gold camp.
(Starting on May 15, the crest of the migration wave would pass Scotts
Bluff about mid June.) Some were later still, and had to be rescued
from early snows of the Sierras. A disconsolate few would spend the
winter at Fort Laramie or Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Wherever and whenever they arrived, the Forty-niners were in
scarecrow condition with few worldly possessions. Stoves, anvils, plows,
furniture, and hardware of every description were thrown overboard
from prairie schooners to ease the strain on the animals. Often this
sacrifice was in vain; dead horses and oxen, littered the road to California
gold.</p>
<p>How many Forty-niners? The population of California increased
some 40,000 in 1849; it is estimated that 15,000 sailed around Cape
Horn or made sailing connections at Panama; of 30,000 who went
overland, perhaps 5,000 died en route. In seven succeeding years,
1850-56, the California gold rush was resumed each spring. No
official census was possible, but a register kept at Fort Laramie helps
to estimate that during the period 150,000 people journeyed overland
westward. The peak year was 1852, when an estimated 50,000 emigrants
poured through Scotts Bluff Pass.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>Oregon-California Trail Geography at Scotts Bluff</i></span></h2>
<p>Today the hills of the North Platte Valley are not accounted among
the scenic wonders of the United States; in Oregon Trail days, to
emigrants who had been bored with the flatness and drabness of the
Platte scenery, and who would be too exhausted later to appreciate
the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the landmarks along the Platte
had a captivating charm. Courthouse Rock and Chimney Rock were
the appetizers; Scotts Bluff was the grand climax.</p>
<p>A typical journal entry of 1849 is that of Alonzo Delano:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 9: The wind blew cold and unpleasant as we left our pretty encampment
this morning for Scott&rsquo;s Bluff, a few miles beyond. The bare hills
and water-worn rocks on our left began to assume many fantastic shapes,
and after raising a gentle elevation, a most extraordinary sight presented
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
itself to our view. A basin-shaped valley, bounded by high rocky hills,
lay before us, perhaps twelve miles in length, by six or eight broad. The
perpendicular sides of the mountains presented the appearance of castles,
forts, towers, verandas, and chimneys, with a blending of Asiatic and
European architecture, and it required an effort to believe that we were
not in the vicinity of some ancient and deserted town. It seemed as if
the wand of a magician had passed over a city, and like that in the Arabian
Nights, had converted all living things to stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent research has cleared up long-standing confusion about the
geography of the Oregon-California Trail in the vicinity of Scotts
Bluff. Today Scotts Bluff is understood to mean the large bluff within
the national monument, between the river badlands and Mitchell Pass,
which separates it from a ridge extending westward at a right angle;
about 10 miles south of the river, parallel to this ridge, lies the Wildcat
Hills, which extend for over 25 miles, from Chimney Rock to
Robidoux Pass (see <a href="#map2">map</a>). Because of this modern nomenclature,
some historians have misunderstood the emigrant diaries, failing to
realize that in Oregon Trail days Scotts Bluff, frequently spelled
&ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs,&rdquo; commonly referred to all these hills, including the
Wildcat Hills. William Kelly, above-mentioned, showed remarkable
acumen in likening the outline of Scotts Bluff to a shepherd&rsquo;s crook,
with the present Wildcat Hills as the straight staff and present Scotts
Bluff as the flair at the end of the crook.</p>
<p>Similarly, the identity of the pass at Scotts Bluff has frequently been
misunderstood. In historic times there were actually two different
passes here. The first, which would be at the bow of the shepherd&rsquo;s
crook, is now called Robidoux Pass, and this was predominantly used
during the period up to and including 1849. In October 1850, Government
explorer Capt. Howard Stansbury, returning from Salt Lake,
reported the first evidence of wagon wheels through the gap now called
Mitchell Pass.</p>
<p>Explanation for the splitting of the Oregon-California Trail at Scotts
Bluff lies in its peculiar topography. The main bluff lays like a giant
whale across the valley floor, blocking the way, with impenetrable
badlands between it and the river. Although the existence of Mitchell
Pass was, of course, known prior to 1850, it was little used because
of its rugged badlands character. Travel via Robidoux Pass involved
a wide swing away from the river, beginning at a point west of present
Melbeta and proceeding down present Gering Valley, south of
Dome Rock. In T. H. Jefferson&rsquo;s <i>Map of the Emigrant Road</i>, it is
called Karante Valley.</p>
<p>Emigrant John Brown in 1849 noted that &ldquo;14 miles from Chimney
Rock the road [to Robidoux Pass] leaves the river.... [It] lies
through one of the finest valleys I ever saw and is decidedly the best
twenty miles of road we have travelled.&rdquo; Maj. Osborne Cross, leading a
company of mounted riflemen to Fort Laramie, described the ascent to
Robidoux Pass as &ldquo;<i>the first high hill</i> since leaving Fort Leavenworth.
This is partly covered with cedar, which was the first we had met on
the march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is suspected that the U. S. Army Quartermaster from Fort Laramie
was the first to take wagons through Mitchell Pass, possibly doing
a little engineering to widen the passage and ease the grade.
Later emigrants, finding wagon tracks now going toward Mitchell Pass,
readily switched to the new route. The two branches came together
once more east of Horse Creek.</p>
<p>During the summer migration of 1850, equal in volume to that of
1849, the Robidoux Pass route up Gering Valley was still favored.
Bennett Clark refers to his &ldquo;encampment within a semicircle of high
bluffs, which rise abruptly from the river&rsquo;s edge and sweep around
rain-bow like.&rdquo; To Franklin Street this camp at Scotts Bluff was &ldquo;one
of the most delightful places that nature ever formed.&rdquo; To Thomas
Woodward, &ldquo;Every place seems like a fairy vision. It is no use trying
to describe [Scotts Bluff] for language cannot do it.&rdquo; To Mormon
emigrant Leander V. Loomis the view of the bluffs from the north side
of the river was &ldquo;highly beautiful, almost approaching the sublime.&rdquo;
His journal contains this delectable entry of May 30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This morning there arose a heavy clowd between us and Scotts Bluff,
which hid it entirely from view, and as it rolled away Showing first its
lofty peak, which ascended Some 300 feet in the air, and which was covered
with Small Pine or cedar trees, the scene was highly Novel, and no
less beautiful we could see as it were, standing upon a clowd, a huge
rock, covered with small trees, and as the clowd would rise and fall, it
presented mutch the appearance of a Theater, the trees presented the
appearance of the actors, the Rock, of the Stage&mdash;the clowd of the curtain,
and nature itself was the tragedy they were Acting, each one playing
there parts to perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1851 use between the two passes was perhaps equally divided.
William C. Lobenstine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... We approached the Scotch Bluffs [sic], which we saw the evening
before golden in the light of the setting sun, and our whole attention
was attracted by the grandeur of the former, still more beautiful country.
The appearance of these sand hills, although from far off like solid rock,
has a very accurate resemblance to a fortification or stronghold of the
feudal barons of the middle age, of which many a reminder is yet to be
met with along the bank of the Rhine. The rock itself is separated
nearly at its middle, having a pass here about fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending
at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred
feet. The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is
now preferred by nearly all the emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight
miles from the old road. We passed through without any difficulty and
after having passed another blacksmith shop and trading post, which are
very numerous, protection being secured to them by the military down
at Fort Laramie, we encamped for the night.</p>

<p>With the migration of 1852, the historical spotlight permanently
shifted to Mitchell Pass. During the early fifties the California migration
reached its peak; the charms of Scotts Bluff and the peculiarities
of the new pass were not lost on the new crop of journalists.</p>
<p>It was in 1852, apparently, that the little-used name &ldquo;Capitol Hills&rdquo;
was first applied to Scotts Bluff by Hosea Horn and other guidebook
writers. The origin of this name is suggested in the Sexton diary of
June 10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made our noon halt opposite Scott&rsquo;s Bluff, altogether the most symmetrical
in form and the most stupendous in size of any we have seen. One
of them is close in its resemblance to the dome of the Capitol in
Washington.</p>
<p>There is a pass through that is guarded on one side by Sugar Loaf Rock,
on the other by one that resembles a square house with an observatory.
It is certainly the most magnificent thing I ever saw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>National Wagon Road</i>, a guidebook by W. Wadsworth based
on a trip of 1852, Scotts Bluff is one of the three major landmarks
described on the whole California Road: &ldquo;Here is some of the most
beautiful and picturesque scenery upon the whole route.&rdquo; Wadsworth
labels the Scotts Bluff of today as &ldquo;Convent Rock.&rdquo; In 1853
Frederick Piercy made a remarkable sketch of the bluffs, with buffalo-hunters
in the foreground. He referred to these bluffs as &ldquo;certainly
the most remarkable sight I have seen since I left England.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">The Celinda Himes diary of 1853, describing abandoned log structures,
indicates the occasional use of Robidoux Pass in later years.
The Helen Carpenter journal of 1856, freely quoted in Paden <i>Wake Of
the Prairie Schooner</i>, clearly describes the fork in the road east of Scotts
Bluff, but indicates that most people now took &ldquo;the river road&rdquo;
through Mitchell Pass. She vividly describes also the sheer walls of
Mitchell Pass, the excellent view to be had from the &ldquo;summit&rdquo; of the
pass, the many inscriptions in the clay (long since vanished), and a
soldier&rsquo;s grave on the side of the bluff.</p>
<p>To summarize, Robidoux Pass, 8 miles west of monument headquarters,
was used by the Forty-niners and most of those who preceded
them, including the fur traders, the emigrants to Oregon,
Francis Parkman, Kearny&rsquo;s Dragoons, and the regiment of mounted
riflemen under Maj. Winslow F. Sanderson who in 1849 rode to take
over Fort Laramie. Robidoux Pass has historical primacy as &ldquo;the
first Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs Pass.&rdquo; On the other hand, &ldquo;the second Scott&rsquo;s
Bluffs Pass,&rdquo; now known as Mitchell Pass, was used by 150,000 or
more emigrants, soldiers, and freighters of the 1850&rsquo;s and 1860&rsquo;s. And
it was also the scene of the overland stage, the Pony Express, and the
first transcontinental telegraph. Honors are about equally divided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>Gold Rush Trading Posts at Scotts Bluff</i></span></h2>
<p>The big climax years for Robidoux Pass were 1849-51. A surprisingly
large number of emigrant journals for these years have survived
and most of them devote a lot of attention to (1) the magnificent
scenery of Scotts Bluff, (2) the unusually fine springs and ample firewood
here, (3) the view from the crest of the pass toward Laramie
Peak (then sometimes called &ldquo;the Black Hills,&rdquo; and frequently mistaken
for the Rocky Mountains), and (4) Robidoux&rsquo;s log cabin blacksmith
shop and trading post, and its colorful inhabitants.</p>
<p>Again, recent research, involving journals, Government records, and
interviews with Indian descendants, has uncovered facts concerning
the Robidoux establishment which have long been wrapped in obscurity.
In 1849 emigrant J. Goldsborough Bruff noted &ldquo;a cool clear
spring and brook&rdquo; in the deep gulch around which the wagons had to
detour. &ldquo;Close by is a group of Indian lodges and tents, surrounding
a log cabin, where you can buy whisky for $5 per gallon; and look at
the <i>beautiful</i> squaws, of the traders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another illuminating description is that given by Captain Stansbury
on his westward trip of 1849:</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Robidoux&rsquo;s second trading post at &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs.&rdquo;</i> Sketch by M&ouml;llhausen, 1851.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>... Three miles from the Chimney Rock, the road gradually leaves the
river for the purpose of passing behind Scott&rsquo;s Bluff, a point where a
spur from the main ridge comes so close to the river as to leave no room
for the passage of teams. There was no water between these two points,
a distance of more than twenty miles, and we were consequently obliged
to go on until nine o&rsquo;clock, when we encamped at the bluff, on a small
run near a delicious spring, after having been in the saddle sixteen hours
without food, and travelled thirty-one and a-half miles. The march was
a severe one upon the animals, as they were in harness, after the noon
halt, for seven successive hours, without water. The afternoon was oppressively
hot, and the gnats and musquitoes almost insufferable. There
is a temporary blacksmith&rsquo;s shop here, established for the benefit of the
emigrants, but especially for that of the owner, who lives in an Indian
lodge, and had erected a log shanty by the roadside, in one end of which
was the blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, and in the other a grog-shop and sort of
grocery. The stock of this establishment consisted principally of such
articles as the owner had purchased from the emigrants at a great sacrifice
and sold to others at as great a profit. Among other things, an excellent
double wagon was pointed out to me, which he had purchased
for seventy-five cents. The blacksmith&rsquo;s shop was an equally profitable
concern; as, when the smith was indisposed to work himself, he rented
the use of shop and tools for the modest price of seventy-five cents an
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
hour, and it was not until after waiting for several hours that I could
get the privilege of shoeing two of the horses, even at that price, the
forge having been in constant use by the emigrants. Scott&rsquo;s Bluff, according
to our measurement, is five hundred and ninety-six miles from
Fort Leavenworth, two hundred and eighty-five from Fort Kearny, and
fifty-one from Fort Laramie.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Historical objects from site of Robidoux&rsquo;s trading post.</i> Collection in Oregon
Trail Museum.</p>
</div>
<p>Others wryly note the shrewdness of this makeshift proprietor,
Robidoux. Various journalists refer to two or more &ldquo;Frenchmen&rdquo;
and their squaws, and an indefinite number of children. In 1850
James Bennett found here &ldquo;an encampment of near a 100 Sioux Indians&rdquo;
(relatives, no doubt!). In 1851 Father De Smet, returning
from the Horse Creek Treaty Council, baptized Robidoux&rsquo;s half-breed
children.</p>
<p>In 1851, Robidoux, feeling somewhat overrun by the emigrant
hordes, retired to a secluded canyon about a mile southeast of the
original location. The appearance of this second trading post has
been providentially preserved in a sketch by the German traveler,
Frederick M&ouml;llhausen. The site of this post has been identified in
present Carter Canyon.</p>
<p>Who was Robidoux? Although all the facts are not fully established,
it appears that he was Joseph E. Robidoux, oldest son of the
Joseph Robidoux who founded St. Joseph, Mo.; and that the other
&ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; seen there was his uncle, Antoine Robidoux, who earlier
achieved pioneering fame in Utah and California. The younger
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Joseph is an elusive figure. He may well have been the Robidoux who
led the first American Fur Company contingent by Scotts Bluff, in
1830, and who was seen at Fort Laramie in 1846 by Parkman.</p>
<p>What became of Robidoux? Although reported to have died accidentally
at Scotts Bluff, no grave has been identified. There is evidence
that he returned to the Great Nemaha Indian Agency, in northeastern
Kansas, in the late fifties, and died there in obscurity. There
are many half-breed &ldquo;Robidouxes&rdquo; on Indian reservations in South
Dakota who have identified the Scotts Bluff Robidoux as their ancestor.</p>
<p>Modern research has revealed another fact long lost sight of. Robidoux&rsquo;s
trading post was not the only one in this neighborhood during
the gold rush. It has now been definitely established that, in the
summer of 1849, after they sold adobe-walled Fort John (Fort Laramie)
to the U. S. Government, officials of the American Fur Company removed
to Scotts Bluff. Contrary to a long-held erroneous impression,
their new post was not located near Mitchell Pass (there never
was a trading post near there); it was first located tentatively in Robidoux
Pass, within a few hundred yards of Robidoux&rsquo;s blacksmith shop.
Then, for reasons which can only be surmised, it was moved to a point
6 miles below Robidoux&rsquo;s and 8 miles south of Mitchell Pass, in present
Helvas Canyon. In correspondence of the fur company it was
identified as &ldquo;Fort John, Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This post, being off the main trail, did not rate much notice by
travelers, compared with the attention given to Robidoux, but there
are occasional references. In 1850 James Bennett states that about 7
miles below Robidoux&rsquo;s there was a trading post &ldquo;3 miles to our left,
where we could see a herd of cattle grazing.&rdquo; Sgt. Percival G. Lowe
of the Dragoons, in 1850, reports that &ldquo;we turned south and camped
near a trading post belonging to Major Dripps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Drips, the &ldquo;mountain man&rdquo; who had guided De Smet up
this way in 1840, was later replaced by Joseph Papin of St. Louis, who
died and was buried here. His grave and the outlines of the second
&ldquo;Fort John&rdquo; have been identified. It is not known just when this
place was abandoned. However, when the main artery of traffic definitely
moved from Robidoux to Mitchell Pass, in 1852, &ldquo;Fort John&rdquo;
and Robidoux&rsquo;s post both doubtless &ldquo;withered on the vine,&rdquo; in the
manner of a modern-day filling station which is by-passed by a new
highway.</p>
<p>Collections of historical objects found on the surface of the sites of
Robidoux&rsquo;s two posts and &ldquo;Fort John, Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs&rdquo; are preserved in
the Oregon Trail Museum. Beads, pendants, danglers, belts, buttons,
medallions, coins, traps, bar lead, bullet molds, and other objects testify
to the variety of activities conducted at these stations. Although
long consigned to oblivion, these primitive commercial establishments
were the true beginnings of private enterprise in the Scotts Bluff area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Coming of the Bullwhackers</i></span></h2>
<p>The Grattan massacre of 1854 and retaliation by Harney&rsquo;s forces in
1855 were prologues to the inevitable showdown with the Plains Indians
discussed later. New posts were built, garrisons were strengthened,
and expeditions were launched. In 1857 troops had to be sent
to Utah to quell the rebellious Mormons; at the same time the
Cheyennes staged an outbreak. It became necessary for the Government
to move huge quantities of equipment and provisions westward
up the Platte Valley, and the freighting contractors came into the picture.
Notable among these was the firm of Russell, Majors, and
Waddell of Kansas City (old Westport).</p>
<p>The army freight moved in huge Conestoga wagons drawn by 6 to
8 teams of oxen. A new profession arose known as &ldquo;bullwhacker&rdquo;
and we can well imagine the bedlam that accompanied the passage of
a &ldquo;bulltrain&rdquo; or the process of yoking up the bellowing animals in
the morning after the nightly encampment in the wagon compound.
The experience of taking a bulltrain through Mitchell Pass is vividly
described by T. S. Kenderdine in 1858:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passing over a dreary country, which barely furnished enough of grass for
our famished animals, we arrived at Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs on the afternoon of the
25th. This is a bold escarpment of sand and clay, about a half a mile in
length and near a thousand feet in height, extending southward from the
river and rising like a gigantic barrier to obstruct our way. It was for a
long time visible, and at a distance seemed impossible to be surmounted.
The road forks before we reach the bluffs, one trail passing around its
southern end and re-joining the main road at some distance beyond it,
the other passing directly over its summit. The latter is the worse road
of the two, but it being the shorter, we chose it. We were detained
some time at the foot of the bluff by the breaking of one of our wagons,
but we at last got under way, and commenced our toilsome journey over
it. The ascent was easy and gradual, until we came to a deep gorge,
which intersected our road at the foot of the main bluff. Crossing this
at the imminent risk of being run over by the teams as they plunged
headlong to the bottom, we came to a series of steep hills and narrow,
deep and sandy defiles, through which there was barely room for a wagon
to pass. So squarely hewn were some of these passes, that one could
hardly believe that art had not a hand in their formation. After a vast
deal of exertion we at last reached the summit, when we commenced
the still more dangerous descent. Tumbling pell-mell down narrow passages,
slowly crawling over abrupt ascents, we at length reached the bottom,
and in two miles struck the river and encamped, but not till long
after dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1857, the year of the Utah War, there was quite a crop of Scotts
Bluff enthusiasts. Cornelius Conway, a freighter with the Utah Expedition,
went into raptures over the scenery. He refers to Mitchell
Pass as &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Gap,&rdquo; because of its tortuous passage. Capt. Jesse A.
Gove tells of passing through &ldquo;the celebrated Scott&rsquo;s Bluff, a cut of
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
some 7 miles from the old road.&rdquo; Being rear guard, he had time to
&ldquo;sketch the notch.&rdquo; In 1857, according to Capt. Randolph Marcy&rsquo;s
guidebook, <i>The Prairie Traveller</i>, from the pass &ldquo;the road descends the
mountain, at the foot of which is the Platte and a mail station.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Freighters at Independence Rock.</i> Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
</div>
<p>William A. Carter, civilian trader bound for Fort Bridger with a
U. S. Army contingent, noted the &ldquo;gigantic mass&rdquo; of Scotts Bluff,
which split the trail. The old road to the left was taken by the troops,
but Carter himself was advised</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... to take the straight forward road leading through the chain of
Bluffs and descending by a nearer rout to the Platt again. This, we afterwards
regretted as we got through the pass with great difficulty&mdash;we found
a large freight [wagon] stopped in the pass, the mud being very deep.
The axle of one wagon was broken and a dying ox lying crippled in the
road&mdash;The bellowing of the Ox which reverberated along the bluff&mdash;and
the croaking of the thousands of Ravens that were hovering over, had a
gloomy and ominous sound. This pass is truly a wonder. The bluffs
here form a semi circle and on each side rise up into huge towers which
make the head dizzy to look up at. The passage through is level, but
has been cut into deep ravines by the torrents which run down the sides
of the Bluffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mystic spell that Scotts Bluff seemed to weave about early travelers
continued unbroken during the following decade. Perhaps the
high point in romantic imagination was reached in 1860 by the English
adventurer, Richard Burton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... In the dull uniformity of the prairies, it is a striking and attractive
object, far excelling the castled crag of Drachenfels or any of the beauties
of romantic Rhine.... As you approach within four or five miles, a
massive medieval city gradually defines itself, clustering, with a wonderful
fullness of detail, round a colossal fortress, and crowned with a royal
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
castle.... At a nearer aspect again, the quaint illusion vanishes. The
lines of masonry become yellow layers of boulder and pebble imbedded
in a mass of stiff, tamped, bald, marly clay; the curtains and angles change
to the gashings of the rain of ages, and the warriors are metamorphosed
into dwarf cedars and dense shrubs, scattered singly over the surface....</p>

</div>
<p>The Sioux uprising of the 1860&rsquo;s kept pleasure travel to a minimum,
but even U. S. soldiers, intent on hammering the redskins, gave pause
to express wonder at &ldquo;the Gibraltar of the Plains.&rdquo; For the first time
we have evidence of travelers clambering up the sloping side to the
summit of the bluff, to survey the countryside. In 1862 Burlingame
described the view as &ldquo;a scene seldom vouchsafed to mortals.&rdquo; The
following year A. B. Ostrander, a drummer boy with the volunteer
infantry, laboriously scaled the cliffs, then scrambled hastily down
again to catch up with his regiment when he thought he saw Indians.</p>
<p>Also in 1863 Benjamin M. Connor made note of the wind wailing
dismally through the gap, which he erroneously called &ldquo;Marshall&rsquo;s
Pass, for a captain of my company.&rdquo; Guide Jim Bridger, who had
been one of the first white men to see Scotts Bluff, back in the 1820&rsquo;s,
told Connor that the bluff &ldquo;was named for a man who saved his life
from pursuing Indians by taking refuge in the cliffs.&rdquo; Bridger, who
had been an associate of Hiram Scott, must have known better.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>Scotts Bluff&mdash;The Artistic Record</i></span></h2>
<p>The last noteworthy Oregon Trail journalist was a young &ldquo;bullwhacker&rdquo;
of 1866 named William H. Jackson, who was destined to
become the &ldquo;living link&rdquo; between Scotts Bluff National Monument
and its historic past. When he came to Mitchell Pass he found the
going tough. He reports that &ldquo;we had one of the steepest and worst
gulches to drive through that we have yet had.&rdquo; His outfit camped
just west of the pass. Finding no spring in the vicinity, someone had
to go 3 miles to the river for water. Young Jackson, a man of
notable artistic talent, stopped to sketch the pass. Today, nearly a
century later, his original sketch of Mitchell Pass, together with
dozens of his other original Oregon Trail sketches and paintings, hang
in the William H. Jackson Room of the Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
<p>William H. Jackson achieved fame as the &ldquo;Pioneer Photographer&rdquo;
of the Rocky Mountain West, being the first to make a photographic
record of Yellowstone geysers, the Teton Mountains, and many other
scenic wonders now preserved in National Parks. In 1936, at the age
of 93, he accepted an invitation to make the dedication speech for the
history wing of the new museum-administration building. In 1938
on a visit here he staked out his 1866 campsite, which is now identified
by a trailside marker. After his death in 1943 the American
Pioneer Trails Association donated many of Jackson&rsquo;s original sketches
and later watercolors to the National Park Service, while Julius F.
Stone donated $10,000 as the nucleus of a fund to build a Jackson
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Memorial Room. The building fund was supplemented by public
contributions and the completed wing was dedicated in 1949.</p>
<p>The A. J. Miller sketch of 1837 and the Jackson sketch of 1866, the
earliest and the latest known pictures of Scotts Bluff made during
Oregon Trail days, are the best known today. The Piercy sketch of
1853, above noted, has been rather widely reprinted. Other authentic
contemporary drawings are found only in obscure or rare out-of-print
guidebooks or journals. Noteworthy among these are those of David
Leeper in 1849, Benjamin Ferris in 1854, Cornelius Conway in 1857,
T. S. Kenderdine in 1858, Richard Burton in 1860, and Alfred Lambourne,
date uncertain.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>Pony Express to Iron Horse, 1860-69</i></span></h2>
<p>The California gold rush had not yet abated when strikes of precious
metals were made in Nevada and Colorado (1858-59), later in Montana
and Idaho (1864). The result was a ramification of the old Oregon-California
Trail, with major branches up the South Platte to Denver,
and from Fort Laramie northward along the Bighorn Mountains to
Virginia City, Mont. (the Bozeman Trail). The new mining communities
added their demands to those of Utah and California for
improved communication with the States. In the fifties and sixties
Scotts Bluff witnessed dramatic changes.</p>
<p>The first mail service up the Platte route was inaugurated by the
Mormons; after the army occupied Fort Laramie, military dispatches
were carried on regular schedules to Eastern command posts. Public
mail service to California began in 1851. By 1860 the Central Overland
and Pike&rsquo;s Peak Express Company held a monopoly on mail contracts
between the Missouri and the Pacific.</p>
<p>No frontier institution better dramatizes the spirit of American
enterprise than the famed Pony Express, fast biweekly mail service.
From April 1860 to October 1861 youthful riders on fleet mustangs
pounded between St. Joseph, Mo., and Hangtown (Placerville), Calif.,
braving the elements and Indian dangers. William Russell of the
freighting firm was the promoter of the Pony Express. Although
financially disastrous, it demonstrated the need for Government mail
subsidies.</p>

</div>
<p>Pony Express stations were about 15 miles apart and each rider
made up to 100 miles at a time, changing to fresh ponies at each station.
Stations in the Scotts Bluff vicinity were at Chimney Rock,
near present Melbeta (the Scotts Bluff Station at Ficklin Spring,
named for a company official), and at Horse Creek. The Scotts Bluff
Station, made of massive adobe walls, later became the Mark Coad
Ranch. The thrill of watching a Pony Express rider gallop past is
vividly described in <i>Roughing It</i> by Mark Twain, who was a stagecoach
passenger bound for Nevada. The incident took place just east of
the pass at Scotts Bluff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,
but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed
to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail,
and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our
heads out of the windows. But now we were expecting one along every
moment, and would see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver
exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;HERE HE COMES!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away
across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears against
the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so! In a
second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, rising and
falling&mdash;sweeping toward us nearer and nearer&mdash;growing more and more
distinct, more and more sharply defined&mdash;nearer and still nearer, and the
flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear&mdash;another instant a whoop
and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider&rsquo;s hand, but no
reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and go swinging
away like a belated fragment of a storm!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first transcontinental telegraph line, up the Platte route
through Mitchell Pass, ended the meteoric Pony Express. In 1860
Edward Creighton of the Pacific Telegraph Company had reconnoitered
the Oregon Trail via Mitchell Pass. The active construction
of the line took but a few months, in 1861, and in October telegrams
were going to California. Service in the early days was hampered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Indians, suspicious of the &ldquo;singing wires,&rdquo; who frequently burned
down the poles. There was an early telegraph station at Fort Mitchell,
at the foot of Scotts Bluff.</p>
<p>In 1861, Russell, Majors, and Waddell subcontracted with the
Butterfield Overland Mail Company to operate overland stage and
mail service over the Central Route (moved up from the Southwest
because of the imminent Civil War). There was daily coach service
to California via Scotts Bluff until 1862, when Indian troubles required
the new operator, Benjamin Holladay, to transfer the route
southward, via Lodgepole Creek and Elk Mountain. The days of the
famed Concord stage in the Scotts Bluff area were short lived.</p>

</div>
<p>As the telegraph made the Pony Express obsolete, so the railroad
spelled the doom of the stagecoach and the prairie schooner. The
easy gradient over the Continental Divide at South Pass was the geographic
reason for the centrally located Oregon Trail. However,
political rather than geographic reasons dictated the central location
of the first transcontinental railroad. During the 1850&rsquo;s there were
many &ldquo;Pacific Railroad Surveys&rdquo; which did much to fill in the blank
pages of Western topography, but none of these touched the North
Platte. At the outbreak of the Civil War, President Lincoln decided
that a central overland railroad would strengthen the ties of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Union. It was in August 1865, however, before the seasoned engineer
and Indian fighter, Gen. Grenville M. Dodge, made his reconnaissance
for the future Union Pacific Railroad. Although the route
finally selected followed Lodgepole Creek to Cheyenne Pass, the general
did examine the North Platte, pausing to sketch Mitchell Pass on
August 27. The &ldquo;iron horse&rdquo; reached Cheyenne in 1867, and joined
the Central Pacific with due ceremony at Promontory Point, Utah,
May 10, 1869. This date can be accepted as marking the end of the
historic Oregon-California Trail.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>Warfare on the Plains</i></span></h2>
<p>In the early 1860&rsquo;s the mounted eagle-plumed warriors of the plains,
including the Sioux and Cheyenne, went on the warpath. Scotts
Bluff looked down upon many exciting scenes of conflict.</p>
<p>During the days of the trapper and the emigrant, the Indian had
been generally peaceful, despite occasional pilferings and &ldquo;greenhorn&rdquo;
alarms. Indeed, many white traders, such as Robidoux, had freely intermarried
with the Indians. The migration of 1849, giving evidence
of the white man&rsquo;s strength, coupled with his wanton slaughter of
the life-giving buffalo, caused some uneasiness among the tribes. In
October 1850, Col. E. V. Sumner with a company of mounted infantry
en route to Fort Laramie met and counseled with one band of
Sioux at Scotts Bluff. They, like their red brethren throughout the
plains, were full of complaints. To quiet them, old mountain man
Thomas Fitzpatrick, Indian agent for the Upper Platte, engineered
the greatest Indian peace council ever held on the Plains. This was
at Horse Creek, a few miles west of Scotts Bluff.</p>
<p>In September 1851 around 10,000 Indians from the tribes of the
Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Snake, Ree, Gros Ventre, and Assiniboin
assembled at Fort Laramie. The U. S. Government was
represented by Fitzpatrick; the famed missionary, Father De Smet;
Robert Campbell (one of the founders of Fort Laramie); and D. D.
Mitchell, superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Louis. Jim Bridger
and other oldtimers showed up to help keep peace among traditional
enemies. Because there was not grass enough for the horses of this
vast assemblage, the council moved downriver. It was an historic occasion
with much colorful pageantry. The negotiations went
smoothly, and by &ldquo;the First Treaty of Fort Laramie&rdquo; the Indians
promised to permit peaceful passage of travelers through their domain
in exchange for an annuity of $50,000 in provisions and trade goods.</p>
<p>This peace treaty, like so many others, was soon broken. In August
1854 a misunderstanding between an Oglala Sioux and a Mormon
emigrant, compounded by the inexperience of Lt. John L. Grattan
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
from Fort Laramie, led to the massacre of Grattan, 30 soldiers, and
his interpreter 8 miles east of Fort Laramie. This was &ldquo;avenged&rdquo; in
September 1855 by the slaughter of innocent Brule Indians by an expeditionary
force under Gen. William S. Harney, near Ash Hollow.
En route to Fort Laramie, the cavalrymen trooped through Mitchell
Pass with over 200 fresh Indian scalps in their baggage.</p>

Trails, Rails and War.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1862 there was a bloody uprising of the Minnesota Sioux. Hostilities
spread to the Plains, with grave danger to lines of communication
and army outposts with garrisons depleted by the Civil War.
During this period, Fort Laramie was a headquarters post, occupied
during the crucial years principally by the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry,
under Col. William O. Collins. There was a chain of outposts
up and down the North Platte, from Mud Springs near present
Bridgeport to South Pass, Wyo. These were frequently harassed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. One of these beleaguered outposts
was adobe-walled Fort Mitchell, about 2 miles northwest of Mitchell
Pass.</p>
<p>Initially called &ldquo;Camp Shuman&rdquo; for its builder and first commander,
Capt. J. S. Shuman, it was constructed in 1864, according to official
records, and was last heard of in 1867. The little fort (and later
nearby &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs Pass&rdquo;) was named for Brig. Gen. Robert B
Mitchell (1823-82), commander of the Nebraska Military District, a
citizen of Kansas Territory who earlier fought gallantly in the Civil
War and later became Governor of New Mexico Territory. Fort
Mitchell saw its share of frontier action. Colonel Collins&rsquo; report of
1865 to the regimental adjutant advises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Co H has been Stationed at Fort Mitchell 55 Miles East of Laramie on
the Platte River. The company participated in the celebrated Indian
fights at Mud Springs and Rush Creek where 150 Men under Command
of Lt Col Wm O Collins fought from fifteen hundred to two thousand
of the dusky warriors, since that time this Company has carried the
Mail from Julesberg to Laramie. This has been heavy and laborious
duty, yet they have never flinched but have had the Mail through in
good time. Besides this company has built one Mail Station, near the
noted Land Mark Chimney Rock, besides repairing the one at Mud
Springs.</p>

</div>
<p>The Battle of Mud Springs in February 1865 was an aftermath of
the siege of Julesburg by a horde of Sioux and Cheyenne who were
enraged by a massacre of Cheyennes at Sand Creek, Colo. In zero
weather the small garrison at Fort Mitchell joined Colonel Collins&rsquo;
forces in an attempt to intercept the north-bound Indians. After skirmishing
and light casualties, the Indians withdrew across the North
Platte.</p>
<p>A second engagement near Scotts Bluff was known as the Battle
of Horse Creek. In June 1865, Capt. William D. Fouts led a company
of the 7th Iowa Cavalry who were escorting 185 lodges of supposedly
peaceful Brule Sioux from Fort Laramie to Fort Kearny.
Between Horse Creek and Fort Mitchell the Indians treacherously attacked,
killing Captain Fouts and three soldiers. The Fort Mitchell
garrison rode out to aid the Iowans, but again the Sioux retreated
across the Platte. Colonel Moonlight at Fort Laramie, advised by
telegram from Camp Mitchell, futilely pursued the Indians with a
cavalry force.</p>
<p>Other skirmishes, including besieged wagon corrals, ambushes in
Mitchell Pass, and troops from Fort Mitchell galloping to the rescue,
are reported in the literature, though with scanty evidence.</p>
<p>Fort Mitchell was occupied at various times by units of the 11th
Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, the 12th Missouri Volunteers, and the 18th
U. S. Infantry. The last identifiable commander was Capt. Robert P.
Hughes, of the latter regiment. He was detached there in 1866 by
Col. Henry B. Carrington who, with 2,000 troops and 226 mule teams,
was en route to construct posts along the Bozeman Trail in the Powder
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
River country. Among the few brief eyewitness descriptions which
survive is this impression of Colonel Carrington&rsquo;s wife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... [Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs are] of mixed clay and sand, plentifully supplied with
fossils, and throw a spur across the Platte basin so as to compel the traveler
to leave the river and make a long detour to the south, or to pass through
the bluffs themselves. This passage is by a tortuous gorge where wagons
can seldom pass each other; and at times the drifting snows or sands
almost obscure the high walls and battlements that rise several hundred
feet on either side....</p>
<p>Almost immediately after leaving the Bluffs, and at the foot of the descent,
after the gorge is passed, we find Fort Mitchell. This is a sub-post
of Laramie of peculiar style and compactness. The walls of the
quarters are also the outlines of the fort itself, and the four sides of the
rectangle are respectively the quarters of officers, soldiers, and horses, and
the warehouse of supplies. Windows open into the little court or parade-ground;
and bedrooms as well as all other apartments, are loopholed for
defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All trace of Fort Mitchell has disappeared but a ground plan of the
enclosure is preserved in the Collins Collection of the Colorado Agricultural
College. Three authentic contemporary sketches of Fort
Mitchell have been discovered; one of 1865 by an unidentified soldier
of the 11th Ohio reproduced in <i>The Bozeman Trail</i>; one by an unidentified
artist with the Hayden Territorial Survey of 1867, published in
<i>U. S. Geological Survey of Wyoming</i>, in 1871; and the one by William
H. Jackson, preserved in the Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
<p>Hostilities on the Plains came to a climax when Colonel Carrington
built Fort Reno, Fort Phil Kearny, and Fort C. F. Smith on the
Bozeman Trail. This trail extended from Fort Laramie northwestward
to Virginia City, Mont., scene of a new gold rush. Capt. William
J. Fetterman and 80 men were slain in an ambush in December
1866 at Fort Phil Kearny (near present Buffalo, Wyo.). In 1867 Red
Cloud&rsquo;s warriors were repulsed at the Wagon Box and Hayfield
Fights; but the Government decreed that this trail to the Montana
mines must be abandoned. By the second treaty of Fort Laramie, in
1868, the Sioux were granted an extensive hunting domain between
the North Platte and Missouri Rivers.</p>
<p>The treaty of 1868 marked the end of major Indian hostilities in
the North Platte Valley. In 1870 Red Cloud was induced to visit the
Great White Father (President Grant) in Washington; he was also
taken to New York City, where he gave an impressive oration in his
native tongue to the assembled palefaces. Red Cloud wanted an
agency and trading post set up near Fort Laramie, long the traditional
camp of the Oglala Sioux. The Government wanted to set up the
agency far north of the Platte, on the White River. To humor the
Indians, still in a resentful mood, the first Red Cloud Agency was established
on the north bank of the Platte, half way between Fort
Laramie and Scotts Bluff, at present Henry, Nebr., on the Wyoming
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
boundary. This became the temporary home of more than 6,000
Dakota Sioux (mainly Oglala and Brule), 1,500 Cheyenne, and 1,300
Arapaho.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="601" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Chief Red Cloud.</i>
Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum.</p>
</div>
<p>Under the prevailing peace policy the Episcopal Church took over
the Sioux Agency. Their first agent was J. W. Wham. Unable to
control Red Cloud and his excitable warriors, Wham was soon replaced
by another churchman, J. W. Daniels. It was not easy for the
victors of the Bozeman Trail war to mend their ways. The Sioux
ambushed Pawnee buffalo-hunters in 1873 at Massacre Canyon on the
Republican River; others joined hostiles on the Powder River in an
attack on the Crow Indians and on the Northern Pacific survey parties
on the Lower Yellowstone River. In 1873, Daniels finally managed
to persuade these &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; Indians to move the agency to White
River, where Fort Robinson was established the next year.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874, the attempt to
reduce further the Sioux reservation, the swift events which culminated
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
in the disastrous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, and the
subsequent rounding up of the scattered Sioux to be placed on Dakota
reservations, the killing of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson&mdash;all these
events occurred far to the north of Scotts Bluff. The only &ldquo;wild
Indians&rdquo; to appear again in this area were Dull Knife&rsquo;s Cheyennes,
who passed here in 1878 in a spectacular northward flight from their
hated reservation in Oklahoma.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>Hunters, Miners, Cowboys, and Homesteaders</i></span></h2>
<p>The ruthless hide-hunters were effective allies of the U. S. Army in
ending resistance of the Plains Indian to the white man&rsquo;s advance.
The American bison, or buffalo, had been the staff of life and the
major source of food, clothing, and shelter for the Indians. Once vast
buffalo herds, blackening the landscape, crossed and recrossed the
North Platte River. The many expeditions and the emigrants on the
California Road killed the huge shaggy beast wholesale. As a result,
most of the herds withdrew to the southern Plains.</p>
<p>Construction of transcontinental railroads and the addition of new
military posts along their route created a huge demand for fresh meat;
in the East there was a good market for buffalo robes. The result was
an intensive campaign of slaughter by professional hunters, armed
with heavy Sharps and Ballard buffalo rifles. The stupid creatures
were easy game for the hunter, who ran after them Indian fashion or
calmly mowed them down from a prone position, as they grazed. In
the mid-seventies the Kansas Pacific Railroad alone hauled out the
carcasses of 3 million buffalo. It is estimated that more than 30 million
buffalo were destroyed during the two decades, 1860-80. Descendants
of the few creatures that survived this slaughter are now to
be found only in zoos and in Government preserves, such as Yellowstone
National Park.</p>
<p>The Black Hills Gold Rush of 1876 by-passed Scotts Bluff. Hopeful
prospectors rode the Union Pacific Railroad to Sidney or Cheyenne,
then followed trails northward to the diggings. The Sidney-Black
Hills route crossed the North Platte over a private toll bridge at Camp
Clarke, near modern Bridgeport. The Cheyenne-Deadwood Trail
crossed a new Army-built iron truss bridge over the North Platte at
Fort Laramie.</p>
<p>The last chapter in the pre-settlement history of Scotts Bluff could
be entitled &ldquo;The Cowboy Era.&rdquo; The open range cattle industry really
began during Oregon Trail days, when sharp traders in the Fort
Laramie area discovered that there was profit in exchanging one head
of fat cattle for two that were worn out. They also discovered that
oxen wintered well in the Laramie River Valley. Demand for cattle
increased with the big Utah overland freighting business of the 1850&rsquo;s.
After the Civil War herds of half-wild longhorn Texas cattle were
rounded up for the long drive northward to shipping points on the
Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific Railways. In 1868 Texas cattle
reached Kearney, North Platte, and Ogallala.</p>

<p>In the 1870&rsquo;s ranchers began to appropriate lush grazing lands in
the North Platte Valley and its tributaries. It is said that by 1872
there were 60,000 head on Horse Creek, near Scotts Bluff. After the
mop-up of hostile Sioux bands in 1876-77, thousands more were driven
from Ogallala past Scotts Bluff toward the vast ranges in the northern
Plains. Pratt and Ferris, Swan Land and Cattle Company, and the
Coad Brothers were among the big outfits who grazed cattle in the
Scotts Bluff area. Rapid inflation of the cattle market, overstocking
and overgrazing, coupled with the disastrous hard winter of 1885-86,
hastened the end of this short-lived but much publicized era.</p>
<p>In 1885 the first homesteaders, or grangers, arrived to stake out
their claims in the Nebraska Panhandle. Gering was platted in 1888.
In 1900 the Burlington Railroad was built up the north side of the
Platte and the town of Scottsbluff was born. In 1910 a Union Pacific
branch line was built up the south bank.</p>
<p>Where buffalo once roamed there are now irrigation ditches, sugar
beet, alfalfa, and potato fields, and prime Herefords. The wily Sioux
have become peaceful citizens. The dusty roads of the covered
wagons have been replaced by broad paved highways and fast automobiles.
Bullboats and Conestoga wagons have been replaced by
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
long freight trains and cometlike aircraft. Scotts Bluff, named for one
of General Ashley&rsquo;s fur traders, the brooding sentinel of the Oregon
Trail, now belongs to history.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>Natural History of Scotts Bluff</i></span></h2>
<p>Although Scotts Bluff is primarily significant because of its historical
associations, its geology and biology are also interesting. Indeed, appreciation
of the history of the bluff is enhanced by an understanding
of how this bluff was formed and how it influenced migration routes.
An elementary knowledge of the plant and animal life of the area,
which is today much as it was in the covered wagon era, adds to your
understanding of this story.</p>
<h3><i>Elevations.</i></h3>
<p>The highest point in the monument area is South Bluff,
4,692 feet above sea level. (The highest point in Nebraska, more
than 5,000 feet, is in Banner County, south of Scotts Bluff.) The
&ldquo;high point&rdquo; on Scotts Bluff proper is 4,649 feet, which is 766 feet
above the North Platte River or 700 feet above the badlands at its immediate
base. The elevation of monument headquarters is 4,114 feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h3><i>Geology.</i></h3>
<p>This bluff, like the neighboring Wildcat Hills, Chimney
Rock, and Courthouse Rock, is an erosional remnant of the ancient
Great Plains. These plains were formed by the deposit of gravel,
sand, and silt brought down by rivers from the Rocky Mountains
after they were uplifted about 60 million years ago. At intervals, 30
to 40 million years ago, volcanoes to the west also added great quantities
of ash and dust deposits. When the process of deposit slowed,
erosion gained headway, cutting new river valleys in the Plains. High
tablelands were left on both sides of the North Platte Valley. Landmarks
such as Scotts Bluff and Chimney Rock have hard rock caps
that protect them from erosion.</p>
<p>The lower two-thirds of the bluff consists of Brule clay, an Oligocene
deposit of buff-colored, soft-textured sandy clay. The badlands
formation at the foot of the bluff dramatically demonstrates the rapid
erosion of the Brule clay when unprotected by cap rock. The upper
one-third of the bluff consists of the Arickaree formation, gray sand
beds of the Miocene Epoch. The uppermost Arickaree beds form the
top surface of the bluff. These are laced with hard tubular concretions
which help protect the bluff and add to the resistance of the
beds to weathering. All the formations exposed in the walls of the
bluff are interspersed with thin layers of pinkish volcanic ash.</p>
<h3><i>Paleontology.</i></h3>
<p>The Badlands regions of western Nebraska and South
Dakota have become world famous for their extensive deposits of fossils
of mammals and other animals that lived during the Oligocene
and Miocene Epochs of the Cenozoic Era. The Brule clay formation
of Scotts Bluff and vicinity is particularly rich in fossil remains of extinct
animals of Oligocene age, 30 to 40 million years ago. These
exposed remains gave rise to many Indian legends and were frequently
noted by curious emigrants. Scientists from many institutions
of learning have continued to explore and examine these fossils
since 1847, when Dr. Hiram Prout of St. Louis described a jawbone
brought to him by a fur trader as that of a <i>Titanothere</i>, a giant rhinoceros-like
creature.</p>
<p>Among the most common fossils of the Scotts Bluff vicinity, now
in the collections of the Oregon Trail Museum, are giant turtles, pig-like
<i>Oreodonts</i> ancient forms of rhinoceroses, saber-toothed tigers,
dogs, deer, camels, and rodents. The horse family is represented here
by <i>Mesohippus</i>, a three-toed creature about 18 inches in height.</p>
<h3><i>Plantlife.</i></h3>
<p>The conspicuous trees on the summit and north slopes
of Scotts Bluff are ponderosa pine and a juniper usually called Rocky
Mountain red cedar. In ravines and along the river banks are cottonwood,
willow, and boxelder. The most common shrubs in the area
are mountain-mahogany, wild currant, and wild rose. Wildflowers include
sunflower, daisies, wild sweetpea, golden banner, penstemon,
Indian paintbrush, yucca or soapweed, ball cactus, and prickly pear
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
cactus. The dominant grasses are blue grama, side-oats grama, buffalo-grass,
slender and western wheatgrasses, and woolly sedge.</p>
<h3><i>Wildlife</i>.</h3>
<p>During historic times the North Platte Valley was in the
heart of buffalo country, but extermination in the 1870&rsquo;s brought an
end to the era of the wild buffalo (bison), which had been the staff
of life to the Plains Indians and the main food supply on the white
man&rsquo;s frontier. A small captive herd of bison is preserved today in
nearby Wildcat Hills State Park. The bighorn and the grizzly, described
by early travelers, disappeared by 1860, leaving an occasional
rare skull as their last testament. The pronghorn (antelope) is still
common in the tablelands north and south of Scotts Bluff, but deer
are the only large hoofed animals which still frequent the monument
area. Other survivors include red fox, coyote, raccoon, porcupine,
badger, beaver, muskrat, and fox squirrel. Prairie dogs, once abundant,
have virtually disappeared.</p>

<p>There is a wide variety of bird life. Some of the species that have
been seen at Scotts Bluff are&mdash;double-crested cormorant, great blue
heron, black-crowned night heron, mallard, green-winged and blue-winged
teal, American merganser, turkey vulture, red-tailed hawk,
golden eagle, sparrow hawk, killdeer, spotted sandpiper, Franklin&rsquo;s
gull, mourning dove, great horned owl, (western) burrowing owl,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
western kingbird, horned lark, cliff swallow, American magpie, rock
wren, mockingbird, mountain bluebird, Townsend&rsquo;s solitaire, loggerhead
shrike, western meadowlark, and spotted towhee junco.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>Prehistory of the Scotts Bluff Region</i></span></h2>
<p>Although collections of stone projectile points, scrapers, hammerstones,
knives, clay pottery, and other primitive Indian artifacts have
been assembled from scattered sites in the North Platte Valley, the
story of prehistoric man in the Scotts Bluff region is still incomplete.
Only a dim outline of the ancient past is beginning to emerge from
the patient studies of archeologists.</p>
<p>Vague evidence of aboriginal campsites and signal fires has been
found on the summit of Scotts Bluff. However, the story of ancient
man in this section of the Great Plains is better suggested by five
other nearby Indian occupation sites:</p>
<h3><i>Signal Butte.</i></h3>
<p>At the western terminus of Wildcat Hills, about 12
miles southwest of Scotts Bluff, archeologists of Nebraska University,
in 1932, probed the top of an isolated bluff which is now famous as
a key archeological site. A 13-foot vertical cross section revealed three
separate levels, each bearing cultural material. The lowest level is
believed to represent a hunting complex (Early Lithic Period), perhaps
5,000 years old. The second level (Intermediate Lithic Period),
described as Pre-Woodland, is given a tentative age of 1,500 years.
The uppermost level (Ceramic Period) contains artifacts of the Dismal
River and Upper Republican cultures, including pottery. The primitive
farmers representing the Upper Republican culture occupied Signal
Butte when Columbus discovered America, while the Dismal
River people are believed to have been an Apache group of about A. D.
1700.</p>
<h3><i>Scotts Bluff Bison Quarry.</i></h3>
<p>In 1933 archeologists of the University
of Nebraska State Museum, while excavating in the bank of Kiowa
Creek, near Signal Butte, found stone projectile points in association
with an extinct form of giant bison. This remarkable find, which established
Scottsbluff points as a classic type, was among the earliest
of a series of discoveries in the Great Plains which have furnished unmistakable
evidence of mysterious big game hunters who inhabited
the Plains some 10,000 years ago.</p>
<h3><i>Spanish Diggings.</i></h3>
<p>About 60 miles northwest of Scotts Bluff, in
Wyoming, lies an extensive area of flinty hills and wastes which have
large numbers of ancient quarries. Thousands of artifacts of primitive
manufacture suggest the Intermediate Lithic Period preceding the
dawn of the Christian era.</p>
<h3><i>Scotts Bluff Potato Cellar Site.</i></h3>
<p>Near the east Slope of Scotts Bluff,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
in 1934, a farmer reported the occurrence of several skeletons and associated
stone and bone artifacts while excavating for a potato storage
bin. This appears to have been a burial ground of early Nebraska
hunters, or foragers, possibly contemporary with the Intermediate
Lithic level at Signal Butte.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Yucca in bloom at the summit of Scotts Bluff.</i></p>
</div>
<h3><i>Ash Hollow Cave.</i></h3>
<p>About 100 miles downstream from Scotts Bluff,
near a famous Oregon Trail campsite, is a rock shelter, excavated by
the Nebraska State Historical Society in 1939, which contained evidence
of 7 occupations over a period of 2,000 years. These range from
the Intermediate Lithic, or second level at Signal Butte, through the
Woodland, Upper Republican, and Dismal River complexes of the
Ceramic Period.</p>
<p>When white men first penetrated Nebraska, about A. D. 1700, the
Central Plains were divided into hunting areas held by tribes living
in large fortified villages. They fed on buffalo meat obtained by seasonal
hunts, and on corn, beans, and squash grown near their villages.
The Pawnee were the dominant Nebraska tribe when the region was
first seen by white men, but the region was soon invaded by Sioux,
Cheyenne, Kiowa, and other tribes. With the introduction of horses
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
and guns by Europeans, the Plains Indians became the bold, wide
ranging buffalo hunters and fighters famous in annals of the white
man&rsquo;s Wild West.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<h3><i>Location of the Monument.</i></h3>
<p>Scotts Bluff National Monument adjoins
the south bank of the North Platte River, in Scotts Bluff County,
western Nebraska, 3 miles west of Gering via State Route 86, and 4
miles southwest of Scottsbluff which is on the north side of the river,
on U. S. 26. The highway route on the north side of the North
Platte River from Broadwater to the city of Scottsbluff in part parallels
the course of the Mormon Trail. If you approach this historic
landmark from the east, you can follow the classic Oregon Trail route
to this point by driving up the North Platte Valley via U. S. 26 from
Ogallala through Bridgeport (Courthouse Rock) to South Bayard
(Chimney Rock) and State Route 86 from South Bayard to Gering.</p>
<h3><i>Trans-Monument Road.</i></h3>
<p>The monument area is bisected from east
to west by State Route 86, the principal approach being from the east
through Gering. The Mitchell Pass route of the old Oregon Trail
coming in from the east to the north of Dome Rock intersects this
highway just south of the east entrance to Scotts Bluff National
Monument. From this entrance to monument headquarters, the highway
roughly follows the roadbed of the old Oregon Trail. Near
monument headquarters, remains of the trail swing south of the highway
before recrossing it to make the ascent through Mitchell Pass,
which separates South Bluff from Scotts Bluff proper.</p>
<h3><i>Mitchell Pass Area.</i></h3>
<p>At the crest of Mitchell Pass, State Route 86
continues westward through Mitchell Valley to the Wyoming State
line. From the pass, the trough of the Oregon Trail makes an abrupt
hairpin turn to get around the head of a ravine, then veers northwestward
toward the North Platte River, and the old crossing at the
mouth of Horse Creek, near present Lyman, Nebr. In Mitchell Pass
and a few hundred yards west thereof, the Oregon Trail trough is exceptionally
well-defined despite the passage of nearly 100 years since
it was heavily traveled. The unusual depth of the old trail through
this area results from the fact that the countless thousands of animals
and wagons had to go single file through the Mitchell Pass bottleneck.
There is a trail from the Mitchell Pass parking area to the
William H. Jackson campsite marker.</p>
<h3><i>Visitor Center.</i></h3>
<p>The dominant building at the monument headquarters
area, just east of Mitchell Pass, is the Visitor Center, which
houses the Oregon Trail Museum and monument administrative offices.
The principal features of the museum are: (1) The entrance
lobby, adorned with bronze Oregon Trail and Pony Express plaques;
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
(2) the main History Room, featuring exhibits relating to Scotts
Bluff and the Oregon Trail from earliest explorations to the open
range cattle industry; (3) the William H. Jackson Memorial Room,
containing a collection of Jackson&rsquo;s Oregon Trail sketches and watercolor
paintings, together with two dioramic scenes of frontier buffalo
hunting; and (4) the Prehistory Room, with displays describing the
geologic formation of Scotts Bluff, its paleontological (fossil) story,
and the prehistoric Indians of the North Platte Valley.</p>
<p>Uniformed personnel are stationed at the Visitor Center throughout
the year. Seasonal public services include orientation talks in the
museum rooms and at the summit of Scotts Bluff; evening illustrated
talks in the museum courtyard; and guided hikes over the Oregon
Trail and over the Summit-Museum Trail. Free informational literature
and sales publications of special historical interest, and signs,
markers, and wayside exhibits are available throughout the year.</p>
<h3><i>Scotts Bluff Summit Road and Summit Area.</i></h3>
<p>During the 1930&rsquo;s, a
paved road 1.7 miles in length, requiring three tunnel excavations,
was built from the monument headquarters area to the summit, to enhance
visitor appreciation of the bluff&rsquo;s scenic and historic values.
The road leads to a 50-car parking area on top. At the Summit Road
entrance gate, adjoining the Visitor Center, cars are welcomed by a
uniformed ranger. There is a fee collected here for use of the Summit
Road, which is open daily except when weather conditions make
driving hazardous.</p>
<p>The summit area is several acres in extent. Surfaced trails reach
the principal overlooks. The main trail proceeds north from the area
to the High Point of the bluff (4,649 feet above sea level), then
meanders to the Observation Point above the north face of the bluff.
At the foot of the bluff are the scenic badlands and the North Platte
River, while the historic North Platte Valley stretches to the horizon
east and west. An orientation map and bronze indicators will enable
you to trace the route of the Oregon and Mormon Trails through
this valley, and to determine the direction of the following points of
interest: Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, Castle Rock, Rebecca
Winters&rsquo; Grave; Agate Springs Fossil Quarries, Fort Mitchell, Fort
Laramie, and Laramie Peak.</p>
<p>A trail south from the parking area will enable you to reach a point
overlooking the Visitor Center, Mitchell Pass, and the beginning loop
of the Summit Road. Beyond Dome Rock is Gering Valley, through
which was the Robidoux Pass route of the Oregon Trail.</p>
<h3><i>Summit-Museum Trail.</i></h3>
<p>A feature of the monument which affords
extra scenic and inspirational benefit is a 1.6-mile-long trail extending
from the summit to the headquarters area via a series of zig-zags and
ledges, a foot tunnel, and &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Spring.&rdquo; Not only does this trail
afford superb scenic views of the bluff, it enables you to examine at
close hand the successive rock strata that comprise the bluff, and to
walk through varyingly vegetated slopes and fields. Descent of the
bluff on foot by this trail is a popular activity. There are those who
arrange to have someone in their party drive the car back down to
the headquarters area, while others make the round trip by foot.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Visitors on the Oregon Trail west of Mitchell Pass.</i></p>
</div>
<h3><i>Badlands Area.</i></h3>
<p>The section between the steep bluff and the river
is characterized by a tortuous labyrinth of steep-sided gullies known
as &ldquo;badlands.&rdquo; The badlands area is of historical interest since it was
the impassability of this ground that forced the earliest emigrants on
the trail to detour away from the river, first through Robidoux Pass,
and later through Mitchell Pass. The badlands are also of exceptional
geologic interest as an example of rapid erosion in soft rock beds of
comparatively uniform composition. There is a natural bridge in one
of the ravines. The area is of special interest paleontologically because
of the wealth of Oligocene fossils to be found there. A graveled
road within the monument boundaries follows the Gering Canal
through the badlands area. This can be reached via the road to Scotts
Bluff Country Club, at the east foot of the bluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3><i>South Bluff Wild Area.</i></h3>
<p>The area within the monument south of
State Route 86, including Dome Rock and the South Bluff, is unimproved
and no improvements are planned. This is a relatively unspoiled
area of considerable scenic value, abounding in features of geological
and botanical interest. You are free to ascend South Bluff or
roam on foot through this area on either side of Mitchell Pass; however,
no fires or overnight camps are permitted. Rough clothing and
stout footgear are recommended. Climbing of Dome Rock is extremely
perilous, and is discouraged because of the crumbly nature of
the Brule clay formation that makes up its steep walls.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><i>Related Areas</i></span></h2>
<p>Nearby Chimney Rock National Historic Site is preserved by cooperative
agreement between the Department of the Interior, the Nebraska
State Historical Society, and the City of Bayard, Nebr. Included in
the National Park System are these other areas commemorating
phases of early western history: Jefferson National Expansion Memorial,
Mo.; Homestead National Monument, Nebr.; Fort Laramie National
Monument, Wyo.; Grand Teton National Park, Wyo.; and
Whitman National Monument, Wash.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Scotts Bluff National Monument was carved out of the public domain
by Presidential proclamation on December 12, 1919, and contains
more than 5 square miles. A superintendent, whose address is Box
136, Gering, Nebr., is in immediate charge.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
